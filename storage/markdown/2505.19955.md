## Abstract 

Recent advancements in AI agents have demonstrated their growing potential to drive and support scientific discovery. In this work, we introduce MLR-Bench ,a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning research. MLR-Bench includes three key components: (1) 201 research tasks sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops covering diverse ML topics; (2) MLR-Judge , an automated evaluation framework combining LLM-based reviewers with carefully designed review rubrics to assess research quality; and (3) MLR-Agent , a modular agent scaffold capable of completing research tasks through four stages: idea generation, proposal formulation, experimentation, and paper writing. Our framework supports both stepwise assessment across these distinct research stages, and end-to-end evaluation of the final research paper. We then use MLR-Bench to evaluate six frontier LLMs and an advanced coding agent, finding that while LLMs are effective at generating coherent ideas and well-structured papers, current coding agents frequently (e.g., in 80% of the cases) produce fabricated or invalidated experimental results—posing a major barrier to scientific reliability. We validate MLR-Judge through human evaluation, showing high agreement with expert reviewers, supporting its potential as a scalable tool for research evaluation. We open-source MLR-Bench to help the community benchmark, diagnose, and improve AI research agents toward trustworthy and transparent scientific discovery. 

## 1 Introduction 

A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to generate new knowledge through research and scientific discovery. From basic research to applied technological development, scientific progress has shaped human civilization. Reproducing this ability—to autonomously generate, test, and validate new knowledge—has long been viewed as one of the grand challenges for artificial intelligence. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) bring us closer to this vision. LLM-powered agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating research ideas [ 15 , 3, 26 , 16 ], conducting experiments and analyses [ 10 , 32 , 4, 38 , 12 , 39 , 14 ], drafting scientific articles [ 23 , 33 , 36 , 1]and automated review [ 34 , 13 , 30 , 6 , 40 ]. These advances move us beyond automating isolated tasks, opening up the possibility of automating the entire scientific process, from idea conception to experimentation to dissemination.

Figure 1: An overview of the framework of MLR-Bench, consisting of both an end-to-end evaluation (left) and a stepwise evaluation (right), each of which uses LLM judges to automatically assess performance over 201 tasks. For end-to-end evaluation, we use the same model as backbone in idea generation, proposal generation and paper writing. For stepwise evaluation, various models are tested and compared within each step. However, realizing this vision raises an important question: how do we rigorously evaluate the quality of research produced by AI agents? While recent works have shown promising results [ 27 , 25 , 18 ,24 , 37 ], the community still lacks a comprehensive benchmark to systematically assess AI agents’ ability to conduct open-ended scientific research, making progress toward autonomous scientific discovery difficult to measure and compare fairly between agents. Moreover, there is also a need for empirical analysis to identify key failure modes—such as hallucinated results, lack of novelty, or methodological flaws — to quantify current limitations and inform future progress in research agents. Toward this vision, we introduce MLR-Bench , a comprehensive benchmark designed for evaluating AI agents on open-ended machine learning research tasks . Specifically, we seek to answer the following research questions: • RQ1: How well can AI agents conduct open-ended machine learning research? (§3) • RQ2 : How effectively can an LLM judge evaluate research, as measured by its agreement with human reviewers? (§4) • RQ3: What are the key factors that affect the quality of AI-generated research? (§5) 

To systematically address these questions, we decompose the research process into four successive stages: (1) idea generation , (2) research proposal formulation , (3) experimental execution and analysis , and (4) paper writing . This decomposition allows us to assess both stepwise progress and the overall end-to-end research capability of AI agents. MLR-Bench consists of three key components: (1) a collection of 201 real-world research tasks sourced from NeurIPS, ICLR, and ICML workshops over the past three years, covering a wide range of machine learning domains, including LLMs, trustworthy AI, ML systems, AI for science; (2) 

MLR-Judge , an automated evaluation pipeline consisting of LLM-based judge and structured review rubrics; and (3) MLR-Agent , a modular research agent scaffold capable of automatically completing these tasks by following the four defined research stages. To explore RQ1, we use MLR-Bench to evaluate six state-of-the-art models—including the most recent o4-mini [ 22 ], Gemini-2.5-pro-preview [8], and Qwen3-235B-A22B [29 ]—as well as the advanced coding agent, Claude Code [ 2 ]. Our results show that while these models perform well 2in generating ideas and writing papers, they often fail to deliver innovative or scientifically reliable research, mostly due to coding agents producing invalidated experimental results. To validate the reliability of MLR-Judge (addressing RQ2), we recruit 10 machine learning experts with top-tier conference review experience to independently review the AI-generated research outputs. We find that the level of agreement between an LLM judge and a human judge, when assessing the same output, is very close to the level of agreement between two human judges, demonstrating its effectiveness as a reliable evaluation tool. Finally, to address RQ3, we analyze the justifications provided by both MLR-Judge and human reviewers, identifying a recurring failure mode where agents tend to generate fabricated or unverified results after execution failures—revealing a gap between fluent output generation and true scientific rigor. Our contributions include: • MLR-Bench : To our knowledge, the most comprehensive evaluation benchmark for AI research agents to date, featuring 201 open-ended ML research tasks, a human-aligned MLR-Judge for automated research quality assessment, and a modular MLR-Agent supporting both stepwise and end-to-end research execution. • Comprehensive Evaluation and Insights : We apply MLR-Bench to evaluate 6 frontier models, providing comparative insights into their strengths and limitations in scientific discovery. Also, we compare MLR-Agent with AI Scientist V2 on MLR-Bench, and find existing research agents exhibit critical failure modes, including the widespread issue of fabricated experimental results and hallucinated methodology, pointing to key challenges for future research. 

## 2 MLR-Bench 

In this section, we describe the overall flow of MLR-Bench. Fig. 1 presents an overview of the framework of MLR-Bench, which consists of both an end-to-end evaluation pipeline to evaluate AI agents’ ability to complete end-to-end research, and a stepwise evaluation pipeline, which separately evaluates AI agents’ abilities on (1) Idea Generation, (2) Proposal Generation, (3) Experimentation, and (4) Paper Writing. 

Tasks. To measure the performance of AI agents across various machine learning topics, we collect 201 tasks from ICLR, ICML, and NeurIPS workshops over the past three years. These tasks are categorized into 9 core ML topics: LLMs and Vision Language Models (VLMs), AI for Science, ML Theory, Trustworthy AI, Computer Vision, ML Systems, Multimodality, Reinforcement Learning (RL), and other emerging topics. Fig. 2 illustrates the distribution of our tasks across these ML topics. To curate our dataset, we first review all workshops from ICLR, ICML, and NeurIPS conferences over the past three years. We then filter out duplicate workshops and select those that maintain complete information and target a general audience. Finally, we extract workshop overviews and topics to formulate our tasks. 

End-to-End Evaluation. To evaluate AI agents’ abilities to fully automate the research process, we give them each of these tasks as input and require them to produce the final completed paper as output, which we evaluate using our MLR-Judge (Section 2.1). To facilitate software experimentation, agents are provided with an environment that includes file system access, a Python runtime for executing scripts, and internet connectivity. 

Stepwise Evaluation. To assess AI agents’ research capabilities in a more fine-grained manner, we evaluate them over 4 steps, using MLR-Judge to assess each step: (1) Idea Generation: we provide the agent with a research task and require it to generate a research idea. (2) Proposal Generation: we provide the agent with a research task and idea, and require it to generate a detailed research proposal. (3) Experimentation: the agent is given access to an environment for running experiments (similar to in the end-to-end case), and iteratively writes code and runs experiments. (4) Paper Writing: 

agents are given a full set of experimental outputs (report, figures, and a log of commands run during experimentation), and required to produce the final paper. This task involves multimodal input and output, so we test multimodal agents in this stage. Each step of the stepwise evaluation requires a set of input data for the agents. For example, in step (1), the Idea Generation agents require research tasks as input data; we use the same 201 tasks used in 3LLM/VLM

end-to-end evaluation. In step (2) the Proposal Generation agents require tasks and research ideas as input. To construct this dataset, for each of the 201 tasks, we randomly sample one idea (generated by any Idea Generation agent) from step (1) for this task, resulting in 201 (task, idea) pairs that serve as the input for step (2). We apply the same procedure in steps (3) and (4), each time randomly sampling from the outputs of the previous step for a task, except in step (3) we manually select a subset of 10 (task, idea, proposal) triples based on their suitability for evaluating the experimentation agents, to keep the experiments manageable. Details about these 10 selected tasks can be found in Appendix A. 

2.1 MLR-Judge 

In this work, we develop an automated evaluation tool, MLR-Judge, which consists of multiple carefully designed rubrics and an LLM judge. Prior to designing these rubrics, we summarize the key review dimensions that people focus on when evaluating research outputs at each step: Consistency ,

Novelty , Clarity , Feasibility , Completeness , Soundness , Insightfulness , Significance and Overall . We tailor rubrics incorporating multiple review dimensions for each research process based on their distinct characteristics. Table 1 illustrates the review dimensions for different research processes. Additionally, MLR-Judge incorporates an LLM judge alongside our rubrics. In this work, we select 

Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview and Claude-3.7-Sonnet as our judge models, which have demon-strated superior reasoning capabilities and multimodal functionality, enabling them to review papers containing figures. These two judge models independently evaluate the quality of research outputs, and the final evaluation results are averaged from their individual assessments. At each research step, MLR-Judge evaluates the Consistency dimension by analyzing both the history information and the output of MLR-Agent. For the experimentation step, we examine the execution log of our coding agent to gain insights into the experimental process. Details of rubrics and prompts of MLR-Judge can be found in Appendix E.2. 

2.2 MLR-Agent 

In this work, we develop a simple and flexible agent scaffold, MLR-Agent, to evaluate the capabilities of different models in conducting open-ended research. The agent is implemented to favour simplicity over extensive prompt engineering, allowing us to directly assess the fundamental performance of each model. MLR-Agent operates in two modes: a stepwise execution mode and an end-to-end execution mode . The stepwise execution mode enables us to evaluate each model’s performance in individual research steps, while the end-to-end execution mode allows us to assess the models’ capabilities in automating complete research projects. MLR-Agent’s automated research process follows the same research steps as illustrated in Fig. 1, namely (1) Idea Generation , (2) Proposal Generation , (3) 

Experimentation , and (4) Paper Writing . MLR-Agent uses LLMs for steps (1) and (2), a coding agent (Claude Code ) for step (3), and multimodal LLMs for step (4). Additionally, since most frontier models currently lack web search capabilities, they face challenges in accessing recent related work. Therefore, MLR-Agent uniformly employs GPT-4o-Search-Preview [ 21 ] to conduct a literature 4Table 2: Evaluated models [ 22 , 2 , 7, 28 , 29 , 8 ] in different research stages.

## 3 How Well Can AI Agents Conduct Open-Ended Research? 

This section describes empirical studies of how well AI agents perform on open-ended research. We use MLR-Agent as our agent scaffold to conduct research and evaluate a number of frontier models, as shown in Table 2. In experimentation and analysis step, our coding agent executes on an Ubuntu 22.04 server with access to four NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs. We use MLR-Judge to evaluate the outcomes of different research processes. We report the average ratings of two judge models, as mentioned in Section 2.1, and details of each rating can be found in Appendix D. 

3.1 Results of Idea Generation Evaluation All models demonstrate strong performance in Consistency and Significance , while Feasibility 

and Novelty are more challenging. We test six frontier models on 201 tasks for idea generation and Table 3 presents the evaluation results. We find that all models demonstrate strong performance, especially in Consistency and Significance , indicating their capability to generate logically coherent and meaningful research ideas. However, there exists a notable performance gap in Novelty and 

Feasibility , suggesting that generating innovative yet implementable ideas remains a significant challenge for current LLMs. 

Model size may not be the sole determinant of idea generation quality. The results show that Deepseek-R1 [7 ] achieves the highest score in Consistency and Overall performance, while 

Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview excels in Clarity and Feasibility . Qwen3-235B-A22B demonstrates particular strength in Novelty and Significance . Notably, even the smaller Ministral-8B [28 ] model achieves competitive performance in Feasibility , suggesting that model size may not be the sole determinant of idea generation quality. Table 3: Evaluation results of six frontier LLMs averaged on 201 tasks in idea generation. Best and worst scores are highlighted in green and red background, respectively. o4-mini-high : o4-mini-2025-04-16 with reasoning_effort set to “high”.

Ministral-8B 8.99 ± 0.36 7.83 ± 0.50 6.66 ± 0.46 6.94 ± 0.67 8.36 ± 0.38 7.68 ± 0.40

Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview 9.20 ± 0.31 8.27 ± 0.31 7.30 ± 0.37 7.11 ± 0.57 8.58 ± 0.35 8.08 ± 0.28 

53.2 Results of Proposal Generation Evaluation All models excel at generating logically coherent research proposals with research significance, but novelty, soundness and feasibility are more challenging. We also evaluate six models on 201 tasks for proposal generation and results are presented in Table 4. The evaluation results reveal a clear pattern in model performance across different dimensions. All six frontier LLMs achieve consistently high scores in Consistency and Significance , demonstrating their strong capability in maintaining logical coherence and research relevance. However, scores for Feasibility and Novelty are notably lower, with scores falling below 7.5 in most cases. This performance gap suggests that models face significant challenges in creating innovative yet implementable proposals. 

Large reasoning models present greater capabilities in generating quality proposals. The results shows a clear correlation between model size and performance in proposal generation. The larger mod-els ( Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview , o4-mini-high , Claude-3.7-Sonnet , and Qwen3-235B-A22B )consistently outperform the smaller Ministral-8B model across all evaluation dimensions. The superior performance of larger reasoning models in generating quality proposals is further supported by their higher overall scores, indicating that model scale and reasoning capabilities are crucial factors in proposal generation. Table 4: Evaluation results of six frontier LLMs averaged on 201 tasks in proposal generation. Best and worst scores are highlighted in green and red background, respectively.

3.3 Results of Experimentation Evaluation Claude Code cannot yet produce solid experimental results. We test the performance of Claude Code on 10 typical ML tasks selected from the 201 tasks. Fig. 3 shows the assessments of two LLM judge models across seven review dimensions. Although the scores of Claude-3.7-Sonnet are significantly higher than those of Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview , both judge models reveal weaknesses in Soundness , Insightfulness , and Significance , suggesting potential limitations in the robustness of the experimental results. Additionally, neither judge model gives an overall assessment higher than 7.0, further indicating concerns about the reliability of the results. 

3.4 Results of Paper Writing Evaluation Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview presents superior performance in paper writing. We evaluate three models with multimodal capabilities on the same ten tasks as mentioned in Section 3.3 in paper writing. The evaluation results presented in Table 5 indicate that Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview demonstrates stronger writing capabilities, while o4-mini-high shows relatively weaker performance. From manual observation, we believe this is partly due to Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview ’s detailed formal explanations, including algorithms, formulas, and derivations, along with its strong mathematical capabilities, while o4-mini-high performs worse due to its relatively terse style affecting its clarity. However, none of the models achieve high overall scores (above 7.0), which may be influenced by the weaker experimental results from the previous step. This demonstrates that experimental success is a critical determinant of overall research quality .Table 5: Evaluation results of three models averaged on ten tasks in paper writing. Best and worst scores are highlighted in green and red background, respectively.

63.5 Results of End-to-End Evaluation Trade-off between performance and cost should be considered when developing research agents. 

On the same tasks in Section 3.4, we test three models for end-to-end automated research. The evaluation results and costs are shown in Table 6. The results demonstrate that all models achieve higher scores in Clarity and Novelty while scores of Soundness and Overall are notably lower. This indicates that current LLMs still have substantial room for improvement in end-to-end automated research. While Claude-3.7-Sonnet demonstrates superior performance across all dimensions (overall score of 4.70), it comes at a significantly higher cost (2.40 USD). Interestingly, o4-mini-high achieves competitive results (overall score of 3.95) at the lowest cost (1.15 USD), suggesting that smaller models can serve as a more economical option for research agents. Table 6: End-to-end evaluation results and costs averaged over ten tasks.

## 4 How Well Is MLR-Judge Aligned with Human Reviewers? 

To evaluate whether our proposed LLM-based judge, MLR-Judge , can serve as a reliable proxy for human reviewers, we conduct a human evaluation study with ten domain experts who have served as reviewers for major machine learning conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, or ICML. For each generated research paper, we assign two independent human reviewers from this expert pool to assess the paper’s quality using the same evaluation rubrics as the LLM judge. Specifically, all review-ers—whether human or MLR-Judge—follow the same review criteria, covering five dimensions: 

Clarity , Novelty , Soundness , Significance , and Overall . The detailed evaluation rubrics are provided in Table 28 and the process is introduced in Appendix F. Novelty Clarity Soundness Significance Overall

Figure 4: Comparison of human-human and human-LLM absolute rating differences across five criteria, with corresponding Mann-Whitney U test p-values shown in the top-left panel. This suggests that the differences between the LLM and human reviewers are not significantly larger than those between two human reviewers. 

Agreement Score. We conduct a significance test (Mann-Whitney U test) to test how well the LLM judge’s scores agree with human judges’ scores, compared to the level of agreement between a pair of human judges. Specifically, we compute (1) absolute score differences between the LLM judge and human reviewers, and (2) absolute score differences between pairs of human reviewers, and test whether these two distributions are statistically different. As shown in Fig. 4, none of the five evaluation criteria show statistically significant differences at the 0.05 confidence level. This suggests that the differences between the LLM and human reviewers are not significantly larger than those between two human reviewers, supporting the hypothesis that LLM and human judgments are well-aligned. Furthermore, the visualized distributions of the rating differences across all five criteria appear highly similar. These findings suggest that the LLM judge produces evaluations largely consistent with human judgment, demonstrating its potential as a scalable solution for automatic evaluation in open-ended machine learning research. 75 What Are the Key Factors Affecting AI-Generated Research Quality? 

We analyze the scoring justification provided by MLR-Judge and human reviewers to identify key factors that affect AI-generated research quality. Among these factors, two stand out as particularly critical: experiment results hallucination and lack of novelty in ideas . We conduct case studies to further investigate why these issues arise and how they impact the overall research quality. 🧠 : Run the experiment wi th reduced epo chs …

Figure 5: For a given paper with its supplementary code, both MLR-Judge and the human reviewer flagged the results as invalid—MLR-Judge by inspecting the provided code, and the human reviewer by noting unrealistic R2 scores. To understand why the results were invalid, we examined the execution logs of MLR-Agent and found that the coding agent failed to run the experiment and instead took a shortcut by generating simulated results, prioritizing completeness over correctness. 

Experiment Results Hallucination. Our analysis reveals a recurring failure mode in AI-generated research: producing unvalidated experimental results . For example, in 8 out of 10 tasks conducted by Claude Code , the reported results were based on synthesized or placeholder data rather than actual execution, as pointed out by our MLR-Judge. This is further supported by the low soundness score: on a scale of 1 to 10, the LLM judge assigned an average score of 3.73 out of 10, while human reviewers gave a slightly higher but still unsatisfactory score of 4.42 out of 10. Both human reviewers and MLR-Judge identified these issues. For example, human reviewers frequently flagged unreasonable outputs inconsistent with common sense, such as “random sampling results should be close to 0.5, but the paper shows 0.65, which seems fabricated” . Unlike human reviewers, who primarily focused on reading the paper content, MLR-Judge leveraged access to the supplementary code and detected even more hallucination cases by inspecting the execution logs and code traces of the coding agent, consistently assigned low scores on Soundness , Insightfulness ,

Significance , and Overall dimensions, as illustrated in Figure 3. To further understand the root cause of these failures, we examined the agent’s execution traces. As illustrated in the case study in Figure 5, these issues often arise when the coding agent encounters execution failures, such as runtime errors or unresolved dependencies. Instead of reporting these failures or halting the process, the agent tends to take shortcuts by generating synthetic results to fill in the gaps. Alarmingly, this behavior persists even when the agent is explicitly instructed not to fabricate results. We hypothesize that the coding agent, particularly Claude Code , prioritizes producing seemingly complete and error-free outputs, and has learned to bypass computational challenges by generating plausible-looking—but ultimately invalid—results as a coping strategy. This behavior highlights a critical limitation of current coding agents in lacking the ability to robustly handle complex execution environments. More importantly, they fail to accurately communicate when they are unable to execute tasks successfully, instead masking failures with fabricated results. This shortcut-taking behavior not only undermines the scientific validity of the generated research but also poses a risk to user trust in AI-assisted research workflows. 

Lack of Novelty. Our analysis reveals that many AI-generated research papers exhibit a common failure mode: presenting ideas that are superficial combinations of existing methods without ad-8dressing any new research challenge. For example, in one generated paper, the model proposes to combine self-consistency sampling with token-level uncertainty estimation. However, the paper fails to articulate why this combination is meaningful, how these two techniques interact, or what specific problem this integration solves. Both human and LLM judges consistently flagged such cases with low novelty scores. Human reviewers described the idea as "a trivial combination lacking clear motivation," while MLR-Judge similarly penalized these papers for lacking insightfulness and significance. Addressing this limitation requires developing agents that not only generate ideas but also reason about their relevance, feasibility, and contribution to advancing the field. 

## 6 Related Work 

Benchmarks for Autonomous Research Agents. Recent works [ 23 , 19 ] have explored using LLMs for various stages of scientific research, including idea generation [ 26 , 9 , 15 ], experimenta-tion [ 10 , 4, 31 , 20 ], and writing [ 19 , 36 , 33 ]. Existing benchmarks typically target narrow tasks: the MLE benchmark [ 4] focuses on engineering, the MLAgentBench [ 10 ] on experimentation, and the PaperBench [ 27 ] on paper reproduction, each revealing gaps between AI agents and human researchers [ 4, 10 , 27 ]. RE-Bench [ 35 ] pushes toward generalization on unseen tasks [ 35 ]. Our proposed MLR-Bench complements these efforts by evaluating 201 open-ended research tasks from major Machine Learning conferences, covering the entire research pipeline. By combining modular agent scaffolds, human-aligned LLM judges, and diverse real-world tasks, MLR-Bench offers the comprehensive benchmark for diagnosing and improving end-to-end research automation. 

LLMs as Reviewers for Scientific Research. LLMs have also been explored as automated reviewers. Prior works like ReviewerGPT [ 17 ] and OpenReviewer [ 11 ] show that LLMs can perform specific reviewing sub-tasks, but tend to produce overconfident and unreliable overall judgments [ 17 , 11 ]. More structured efforts, such as PaperBench [ 27 ], demonstrate that fine-tuned LLM judges can align well with human reviewers on benchmark tasks [ 27 ]. Building on these insights, MLR-Bench introduces MLR-Judge, a rubric-based LLM judge [ 41 , 5 , 42 ] validated against expert human ratings. Our study shows that MLR-Judge can be a proxy of human reviewers, enabling scalable and reliable evaluation of large-scale AI-generated research. 

## 7 Conclusion 

In this work, we introduce MLR-Bench , a comprehensive framework for evaluating AI research agents on open-ended machine learning research. MLR-Bench consists of two key components: (1) a collection of 201 real-world research tasks covering diverse ML topics, and (2) MLR-Judge ,an LLM-based evaluation framework with structured review rubrics for automated assessment of research quality. To demonstrate the utility of MLR-Bench, we also introduce MLR-Agent , a modular agent scaffold that supports both stepwise and end-to-end research generation, enabling systematic evaluation of different models and research workflows. We release MLR-Bench and MLR-Judge as open resources to support the community in benchmarking and improving AI research agents, with the goal of advancing trustworthy and scientifically meaningful AI systems. 

Limitation and Future Work. A key barrier to trusting AI-generated research lies in its lack of process transparency . Scientific research is inherently complex, involving many subtle decisions and details. Human reviewers, when presented with a fully-formed AI-generated paper, often lack visibility into how each part was produced and whether every step is scientifically sound. This makes it difficult to build trust in AI research agents. While our evaluation framework takes a step toward addressing this, we recognize that building human trust in fully automated research remains a long-term and open challenge. We view MLR-Bench not as a complete solution, but as an important first step to help the community systematically analyze, diagnose, and improve AI research agents. Beyond evaluation, we believe that MLR-Bench and MLR-Judge have the potential to serve as valuable feedback signals for improving research agent training. By identifying where agents succeed or fail—such as generating plausible but fabricated results or failing to produce meaningful contributions—our framework can inform the design of better training objectives, reward signals, and alignment strategies. We envision future work that closes this feedback loop, integrating MLR-Judge as part of the training and refinement process for next-generation research agents, ultimately improving their reliability, transparency, and scientific value. 9References

## B Comparison of AI Scientist V2 and MLR-Agent 

In this section, we evaluate AI Scientist V2 [ 37 ], an agent scaffold designed for workshop-level end-to-end automated research, on the ten tasks listed in Table 7, and compare its performance with that of MLR-Agent. For AI Scientist V2, we used o4-mini as the backbone model for the whole pipeline and for each task, only a single attempt was made to generate the paper. For MLR-Agent, we also used o4-mini for idea generation, proposal generation, and paper writing, while leveraging 

Claude Code —powered by Claude-3.7-Sonnet —for experimentation and analysis. Table 8: End-to-end performance comparison of AI Scientist V2 and MLR-Agent. Each score is averaged across 10 tasks. We report the average ratings of Gemini judge and Claude judge. The average costs across these 10 tasks are 1.88 USD for AI Scientist V2 and 1.15 USD for MLR-Agent. 

Review Dimensions Agent Scaffold Clarity Novelty Soundness Significance Overall AI Scientist V2 6.55 ± 0.94 6.70 ± 0.48 3.70 ± 1.29 4.85 ± 1.08 4.25 ± 1.25 

MLR-Agent 7.65 ± 0.32 6.90 ± 0.30 3.80 ± 0.60 5.05 ± 0.57 3.95 ± 0.71 

13 Main Results. Table 8 summarizes the evaluation results from the Gemini and Claude judges. On average, AI Scientist V2 slightly outperforms MLR-Agent, although preferences vary across judges—each judge tends to favor a different model. However, both agents receive average scores below our acceptance threshold (i.e., 6 out of 10). A detailed breakdown reveals that while the agents perform well on Clarity and Novelty , their scores for Soundness and Significance are consistently below the threshold. Despite these limitations in research quality, both agents offer cost-effective solutions for large-scale experimentation, with average costs across the 10 tasks of $1.88 for AI Scientist V2 and $1.15 for MLR-Agent. 

Key Findings. These results lead to three key findings :• The agents excel at both generating novel and original ideas and presenting them clearly. 

Both AI Scientist V2 and MLR-Agent demonstrate a capacity for creativity, reflected in their high scores for Novelty . This indicates that they can propose original research questions and ideas crucial for scientific discovery. Also, the agents’ strong performance in the 

Clarity dimension shows they can articulate these ideas in a well-organized and easily understandable manner; • The methods and experiments proposed by the agents lack technical soundness. Aprimary weakness of AI Scientist V2 and MLR-Agent is that the proposed methods or techniques often lack soundness, which undermines the overall reliability of their research. This finding comes from their markedly low scores in the Soundness dimension, which consistently fall below the acceptance threshold. It suggests that while the agents can formulate creative ideas, the real implementations are frequently flawed; • The research conducted by the agents demonstrates limited potential impact. This limitation is primarily reflected in their consistently low scores for Significance , suggesting the work fails to address important research questions. This lack of perceived contribution, potentially compounded by difficulties in reproducing the experimental results, severely restricts the research’s influence and potential uptake by the scientific community. 

## C Hallucination Analysis of Existing Research Agents 

To further investigate the issues in the content generated by AI Scientist V2 and MLR-Agent, we conducted a hallucination analysis in this section. Specifically, we aim to examine how frequently these research agents (i.e., AI Scientist V2 and MLR-Agent) produce hallucinated content, which types of hallucinations are most common, and how these errors are typically generated. We observe that AI-generated research papers can fail to be trustworthy in several ways: for example, when the proposed method fails to address the stated motivation, or when the conclusions do not logically follow from the methodology. Such issues may stem either from intentional fabrication or from limitations in the model’s reasoning ability. To focus on objectively verifiable errors, we propose four frequently observed, fact-based hallucination types: • Faked Experimental Results: The data, metrics, or experiments’ outcomes are fabricated or never actually performed. • Hallucinated Methodology: The technical approaches are proposed but are not imple-mented (e.g., claiming that the proposed method uses reinforcement learning when it actually does not). • Incorrect Citations: The references to academic papers are incorrect or cannot be found. • Mathematical Errors: Incorrect equations, flawed derivations, or improper applications of mathematical concepts. To efficiently analyze the hallucination content, we first leverage two advanced automated judges— Gemini (Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview-06-05 ) and Claude 

(Claude-3-7-Sonnet-20250219 ) to identify whether each generated paper contains any of these four hallucination types. Then the judgments are verified by our human annotators . To reduce the annotation burden, human annotators are provided with two review files, one from the 

Gemini judge and one from the Claude judge, which contain AI-detected hallucination types and 14 Faked Experimental

Incorrect Citations 

Example: Section 1: “Evaluation on SQuAD, AmbigQA, and TriviaQA-rc, showing up to 6% absolute EM gains and 30% fewer hallucinations.” 

Explanation: The paper claims specific performance improvements on SQuAD, AmbigQA, and TriviaQA-rc datasets, but the code simply assigns perfect accuracy on AmbigQA, without actually running real models on these datasets. 

Example: “Our LLM uses MC-dropout to flag uncertain tokens, generates targeted clarification questions, and proceeds with retrieval and answer generation only after disambiguation. ” 

Explanation: The experiments do not actually implement MC-dropout on GPT-3.5 but instead simulate uncertainty detection and clarification triggers using predefined rules and random thresholds. 

Example: “[7] M. Brown et al., Reinforcement Learning for Code Generation: A Survey, arXiv:2311.67890, 2023. [8] S. Lee et al., Adaptive Code Generation via User Feedback Loops, arXiv:2403.45678, 2024. ” 

Explanation: The arXiv IDs cited in the paper are non-existent and these two “paper title + author” combinations cannot be found. 

Figure 7: Illustrative hallucination cases extracted from papers generated by AI Scientist V2 and MLR-Agent. The case of “Mathematical Errors” is not reported due to its low frequency of occurrence. their corresponding evidence. For each of these types, the annotators examine the provided evidence to verify whether these kinds of hallucination evidence are present in the AI-generated paper. 

Key Observations. Fig. 6 reports the frequency of hallucination types across 10 benchmark tasks and Fig. 7 presents representative examples of each type extracted from papers generated by AI Scientist V2 and MLR-Agent. We have two key observations. Firstly, faked experimental results and hallucinated methodology are the two most prevalent hallucination types in the outputs of both research agents, with each type appearing in more than half of the 10 evaluated tasks. Notably, almost all papers generated by AI Scientist V2 contain these two types of hallucination. As illustrated in Fig. 7, research agents may fabricate near-perfect results to achieve their research objectives, and in some cases, their implementations are not aligned with the proposed method and experimental setup. One possible reason is that the generated ideas lack feasibility, leaving the coding agents unable to utilize available resources to achieve the experimental objectives. The core limitation, however, is that the agents possess no mechanism to verify the practicality of an idea beforehand and flag it. Secondly, nonexistent citations are a significant issue, appearing in 50% of the tasks completed by MLR-Agent. While AI Scientist V2 also exhibits this problem, the prevalence is less severe. We 15 hypothesize that this discrepancy stems from limitations in MLR-Agent’s literature collection tool, which restricts its ability to conduct accurate searches for relevant literature on the web. Currently, relying solely on a few model APIs with search capabilities for literature gathering does not guarantee the quality of the retrieved information. Therefore, future research agent development needs to focus on two key areas. First, it is crucial to enhance the interaction between agents and the web to improve information retrieval. Second, a vetting mechanism must be implemented to ensure the validity and relevance of academic information collected online. 

## D Evaluation Results of Different Judge Models 

This section shows the evaluation scores of different models judged by Gemini and Claude models. We report the results of MLR-Agent in idea generation (see Tables 9 and 10), proposal generation (see Tables 11 and 12), paper writing (see Tables 13 and 14) and end-to-end evaluation (see Tables 15 and 16). For the end-to-end evaluation, we have attached the experimental code along with each sample. In addition, Table 17 and Table 18 present the performance comparison of AI Scientist V2 and MLR-Agent.

E.1 Prompts for MLR-Agent MLR-Agent is a simple and flexible scaffold designed to support open-ended research. It is im-plemented to favour simplicity over extensive prompt engineering, allowing us to assess each large language model’s fundamental performance directly. The automated research process includes four stages: (1) Idea Generation, (2) Proposal Generation, (3) Experimentation, and (4) Paper Writing. Since most models lack web access, we insert a literature 17 review step using GPT-4o-Search-Preview [ 21 ] between stages (1) and (2), providing relevant reference material to the agent. Below are the prompts used for each stage: • Table 19 presents the prompt used for idea generation. • Table 20 presents the prompt for instructing the model to perform a literature review. • Table 21 presents the prompt used for generating the research proposal. • Table 22 presents the prompt used for conducting experiments and obtaining results. • Table 23 presents the prompt used for writing the research paper based on previously generated outputs, including the idea, proposal, and experimental results. Table 19: Prompt used for idea generation . Users provide a task description (in this example, the introduction from the Building Trust workshop), which is combined with the prompt to instruct the backbone model (e.g., Claude) to generate a corresponding research idea. Task # Workshop on Building Trust in Language Models and Applications Input As Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly adopted across diverse industries, concerns around their trustworthiness, safety, and ethical implications increasingly motivate academic research, industrial development, and legal innovation...This work-shop addresses the unique challenges posed by the deployment of LLMs, ranging from guardrails to explainability to regulation and beyond. The proposed workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to explore cutting-edge solutions for improving the trustworthiness of LLMs and LLM-driven applications. The workshop will feature invited talks, a panel discussion, interactive breakout discussion sessions, and poster presentations, fostering rich dialogue and knowledge exchange. We aim to bridge the gap between foundational research and the practical challenges of deploying LLMs in trustworthy, use-centric systems. ## Workshop Scope This workshop has a broad focus, including but not limited to: 1. Metrics, benchmarks, and evaluation of trustworthy LLMs 2. Improving reliability and truthfulness of LLMs 3. Explainability and interpretability of language model responses ... 7. Guardrails and regulations for LLMs 8. Error detection and correction Prompt You are an excellent machine learning researcher. Please generate innovative and practical ideas based on a given task description. Note that there might be a couple of research topics in the task description, and you should focus on one of them. The idea should be no more than 200 words and include the following three sections: 1. Title: A concise and descriptive title for the research idea. 2. Motivation: A brief explanation of why this research is important and what problems it aims to solve. 3. Main Idea: A clear and detailed description of the proposed research idea, including the methodology, expected outcomes, and potential impact. Please directly respond to the idea. Here is the task: {Task} Output # TrustPath: A Framework for Transparent Error Detection and Correction in LLMs ## Motivation 18 As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into high-stakes appli-cations, their tendency to hallucinate, present false information, or make errors poses significant risks. Current error detection methods often lack transparency, making it difficult for users to understand when and why an LLM might be incorrect. This research addresses the critical need for systems that can not only detect errors in LLM outputs but also explain these errors to users and suggest corrections in a transparent, understandable manner. ## Main Idea TrustPath proposes a multi-layered approach to error detection and correction that prioritizes transparency. The framework employs three complementary mechanisms: 1) A self-verification module that prompts the LLM to evaluate its own uncertainty through generated alternative responses and explanations; 2) A factual consistency checker that retrieves information from trusted knowledge sources to verify claims; and 3) A human-in-the-loop feedback system that learns from user corrections. Uniquely, TrustPath presents detected errors alongside confidence scores, reasoning paths, and suggested alternatives through an intuitive visual interface that highlights potential problematic sections of text. This approach not only improves accuracy but builds user trust by making the error detection process visible and understandable, allowing users to make informed decisions about accepting or rejecting LLM outputs. Table 20: Prompt used for literature review . After generating the research idea, we use 

GPT-4o-Search-Preview [ 21 ] to conduct a literature review. The retrieved references are then provided to the model to guide the generation of the research proposal. Prompt You are an excellent machine learning researcher! Please help me do a literature review for a given idea. The idea is based on a given task description. The papers in the literature review should be extracted from arxiv and published between 2023 to 2025. The literature review should include the following: 1. Related Papers: at least 10 academic papers most closely related to the current research idea, with a brief summary and the publication year of each one, organized logically. 2. Key Challenges: A discussion of the main challenges and limitations in the current research. List no more than five key challenges. The paper should be in the format of: 1. Title : <title> (<arxiv_id>) - Authors : <author1>, <author2>, ... - Summary : <summary> - Year : <year> Please directly respond to the literature review and do not include any additional comments. Here is the idea: {Idea} Here is the task: {Task} Output 1. Title : Explainability for Large Language Models: A Survey (arXiv:2309.01029) - Authors : Haiyan Zhao, Hanjie Chen, Fan Yang, Ninghao Liu, Huiqi Deng, Hengyi Cai, Shuaiqiang Wang, Dawei Yin, Mengnan Du - Summary : This survey introduces a taxonomy of explainability techniques for Transformer-based language models, categorizing methods based on training paradigms and summarizing approaches for generating local and global explanations. It also discusses evaluation metrics and the use of explanations to debug models and improve performance. - Year : 2023 ... 19 10. Title : An Explainable AI Approach to Large Language Model Assisted Causal Model Auditing and Development (arXiv:2312.16211) - Authors : Yanming Zhang, Brette Fitzgibbon, Dino Garofolo, Akshith Kota, Eric Papenhausen, Klaus Mueller - Summary : This study proposes the use of LLMs as auditors for causal networks, presenting them with causal relationships to produce insights about edge directionality, confounders, and mediating variables. It envisions a system where LLMs, automated causal inference, and human analysts collaborate to derive comprehensive causal models. - Year : 2023 

Key Challenges: 

1. Transparency and Interpretability : LLMs often operate as black boxes, mak-ing it difficult to understand their internal decision-making processes. This lack of transparency hinders trust and accountability in high-stakes applications. .... 5. User Feedback Mechanisms : Incorporating human-in-the-loop feedback systems to learn from user corrections and improve model performance requires designing interfaces and processes that are both effective and user-friendly.

## F Human Study Details 

To validate the effectiveness of MLR-Judge , we compare its evaluations against those of human reviewers. Specifically, we recruited 10 participants with prior reviewing experience at top-tier conferences aligned with our task domains, including ICML, NeurIPS, and ICLR. Based on their areas of expertise, each reviewer was assigned a subset of AI-generated papers relevant to their 40 domain. Each reviewer received the research paper along with its corresponding supplementary code. We collected all responses through Google Forms. The evaluation criteria followed the same rubric used in the end-to-end setting of MLR-Judge (see Table 28). Fig. 8 and Fig. 9 show the Google Form interface used for receiving the human review data. All collected human review results are available as a CSV file in our GitHub repository under the human-study folder.
