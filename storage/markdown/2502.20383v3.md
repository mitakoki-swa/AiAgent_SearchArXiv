ABSTRACT 

Recent advancements in Web AI agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex web navigation tasks. However, emerging research shows that these agents exhibit greater vulnerability compared to standalone Large Language Models (LLMs), despite both being built upon the same safety-aligned models. This discrepancy is particularly concerning given the greater flexibility of Web AI Agent compared to standalone LLMs, which may expose them to a wider range of adversarial user inputs. To build a scaffold that addresses these concerns, this study investigates the underlying factors that contribute to the increased vulnerability of Web AI agents. Notably, this disparity stems from the multifaceted differences between Web AI agents and standalone LLMs, as well as the complex signals—nuances that simple evaluation metrics, such as success rate, often fail to capture. To tackle these challenges, we propose a component-level analysis and a more granular, systematic evaluation framework. Through this fine-grained investigation, we identify three critical factors that amplify the vulnerability of Web AI agents; (1) embedding user goals into the system prompt, (2) multi-step action generation, and (3) observational capabilities. Our findings highlights the pressing need to enhance security and robustness in AI agent design and provide actionable insights for targeted defense strategies.

1 Introduction 

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities and proficiency in solving complex problems. These capabilities are increasingly being extended to multi-step tasks, driving the evolution of LLM-based AI agent systems (Shen et al., 2024a; Yang et al., 2024b,a; Putta et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024d). One such system is the Web (browser) AI agent, which integrates an LLM with software tools and APIs to execute sequences of actions aimed at achieving specific goals within a web environment. These agents leverage LLM capabilities for planning (Zheng et al., 2024b), reflection (Pallagani et al., 2024), and effective tool utilization (Yao et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024), enabling more autonomous and adaptive web-based interactions. Many previous studies (Wang et al., 2024a; Shen et al., 2024a; Su et al., 2025) have highlighted significant advancements in autonomous web agents. However, despite their promising potential, their safety and security vulnerabilities have not yet been systematically studied. Given their direct integration with web browsers, these agents could be exploited to distribute malware or send phishing Emails to extract personal information, posing serious security risks (as shown in Fig. 1).

Figure 1: Web AI agents exhibit a significantly higher jailbreak rate (46.6%) compared to standalone LLMs (0%), highlighting their increased vulnerability in real-world deployment. In this study, we highlight the heightened vulnerability of Web AI agent frameworks to jailbreaking compared to traditional LLMs. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that web agents, by design, exhibit a significant higher susceptibility to following malicious commands due to fundamental component-level differences from standalone LLMs. Notably, while a standalone LLM (such as a regular chatbot) refuses malicious requests with a 0% success rate, the Web AI agent follows them at a rate of 46.6% (Fig. 1). Importantly, we identify three primary factors contributing to the increased vulnerabilities of Web AI agents: (1) 

Directly embedding user input into the LLM system prompt, (2) Generating actions in a multi-turn manner, and (3) 

Processing observations and action histories, which increases the likelihood of executing harmful instructions and weakens the system’s ability to assess risks. Additionally, we find that mock-up testing environments may inadvertently distort security evaluations by oversimplifying real-world interactions, potentially leading to misleading conclusions about an agent’s robustness. To better understand the heightened vulnerability of Web AI agents to jailbreaking and their increased susceptibility to executing malicious commands, we introduce a 5-level fine-grained ablative metric that goes beyond the conventional binary assessments of LLM vulnerabilities, offering a more nuanced evaluation of jailbreak signals. Ultimately, our study raises awareness of the security challenges posed by Web AI agents and advocates for proactive measures to design safer, more resilient agent frameworks. 

Our contributions: 

• Empirical evidence of Web AI agents’ heightened vulnerability: We systematically compare Web AI agents with standalone LLM chatbots, revealing that Web AI agents are significantly more susceptible to jailbreaking and executing malicious commands. • Root cause analysis of Web AI agent vulnerabilities: We investigate the design-level differences between Web AI agents and standalone LLMs, identifying key factors—such as system prompt manipulation, multi-turn action generation, and reliance on historical observations—that contribute to their increased vulnerability. • A fine-grained evaluation protocol for jailbreak susceptibility: We introduce a structured, five-level harmfulness evaluation framework that goes beyond binary assessments, enabling a more detailed and nuanced analysis of Web AI agent vulnerabilities. • Actionable insights for targeted defense strategies: Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for mitigating security risks in Web AI agents, focusing on improving system prompt handling, action generation mechanisms, and contextual awareness in agent architectures. 2Why Are Web AI Agents More Vulnerable Than Standalone LLMs?

LLMs in Web AI agent systems. Recent advancements in LLM techniques have expanded their role in AI agent systems, enabling them to generate and execute actions (Yang et al., 2024a; Zheng et al., 2024c; Putta et al., 2024; Gou et al., 2024). Among various applications, web browsing has emerged as a key domain for AI agents (Zheng et al., 2024a; Shahbandeh et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024d; Iong et al., 2024), where LLMs assist users in tasks ranging from simple navigation to more complex operations such as booking flights and interacting with web-based maps (Drouin et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024a; Liao et al., 2024). To support systematic evaluation, researchers have introduced several benchmarks, including simulated and self-hostable webpage environments, to comprehensively assess the performance of Web AI agents (Zhou et al., 2023; Koh et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024a). 

Security aspects of AI agents. AI agents assist humans in daily computer tasks, often requiring access to private data and sensitive information, making their security and trustworthiness paramount. Research in this area has focused on identifying security vulnerabilities, attack methods, and defense mechanisms. Several studies highlight significant security risks. Liao et al. (2024) demonstrated that injection attacks can lead to privacy leaks, while Zhang et al. (2024c) examined how pop-up blocks distract agents and manipulate them into executing attacker-intended actions. Additionally, Nakash et al. (2024) revealed how indirect prompt injection attacks 

can coerce agents into performing malicious actions. On the defense side, researchers have proposed various mitigation mechanisms. Balunovic et al. (2024) introduced a 

security analyzer that enforces strict constraints on agent actions. Wu et al. (2024) designed a secure LLM system 

that separates planning from execution, using information flow control and security labels to filter untrusted inputs. He et al. (2024) emphasized the importance of session management, sandboxing, and encryption to enhance AI agent security in real-world applications. To systematically assess vulnerabilities, several benchmarks have been developed. Andriushchenko et al. (2024) evaluated LLM robustness against jailbreak attacks. Debenedetti et al. (2024) introduced a dynamic framework for testing AI agent security against prompt injection attacks. Zhang et al. (2024b) created a benchmark covering over ten prompt injection attacks, including memory poisoning and Plan-of-Thought backdoor attacks. These studies consistently show that LLM-based Web AI agents are significantly more susceptible to jailbreak attacks than standalone LLM systems (Kumar et al., 2024; Liao et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025). However, the underlying causes of this heightened vulnerability remain unclear. Existing evaluations, primarily focus on binary jailbreak success or failure, failing to capture nuanced agent behaviors under varying levels of harmful influence. This work aims to provide a fine-grained analysis of Web AI agent vulnerabilities, identifying the specific components and design choices that contribute to their susceptibility. 

3 Web AI Agent System 

A Web AI agent system, powered by an LLM, operates autonomously by continuously interacting with its environment through an iterative loop of actions and feedback (Yao et al., 2022; Sumers et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Fang et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a). With well-structured abstractions that bridge digital environments and LLMs, these agents can seamlessly translate observations into LLM-readable inputs and convert LLM-generated outputs into executable actions. These connection components between the web browser and the LLM allow the LLM to autonomously generate meaningful actions and produce tangible outcomes within the system. Previous work highlights the essential role of Web AI agents in enhancing LLM performance across diverse environments. (Yang et al., 2024a; Yao et al., 2024). To assess Web AI agent vulnerabilities, we follow the LLM agent workflow, OpenHands (Wang et al., 2024a), formerly known as OpenDevin (Wang et al., 2024b). OpenHands is a flexible AI agent platform widely used in benchmarks (Xu et al., 2024a), prior research (Pan et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024; Zhuge et al., 2024), and the open-source community. The insights from our study are applicable to other frameworks as well. Specifically, Web AI agent systems with an observation processing module (Shen et al., 2024a), action tools (Debenedetti et al., 2024), and actions transformation module for a web-executable format (Su et al., 2025) shares their core components with this study, indicating generalizability of our conclusions. 

3.1 How A Web AI Agent System Works 

A Web AI agent begins by observing both the user’s request and the current environment (e.g., the layout of a webpage). It then translates this information into structured inputs that the LLM can interpret. The LLM processes these inputs and generates corresponding actions for the agent to execute. The system applies these outputs as actionable commands, 3Why Are Web AI Agents More Vulnerable Than Standalone LLMs? A P REPRINT

(a) Users interacting with LLMs. (b) Users interacting with the Web Agent, with colors highlighting Factor 1, 2, and 3, illustrating key component differences grouped by categories (More details in Section 3.2, 4.1) (c) A study analyzing Clear Denial and Vulnerability rate changes through factor ablation and integration. The results indicate that incorporating more agent components increases vulnerabilities compared to the standalone LLM. The changes in the Clear Denial rate(%) help quantify the vulnerabilities introduced by each component. (See Section 5 for more factors and experimental details.) modifying the environment and generating new observations for the next iteration. This cycle repeats until the agent successfully completes its task (i.e., reaches a specified goal) or exceeds a specific predefined iteration limit. Unlike a standalone LLM, which passively generates text responses, a Web AI agent actively interacts with its environment, bridging abstract reasoning with practical execution. For example, when navigating a web interface, the agent can interpret page content, select relevant actions (e.g., clicking buttons or entering text), and adapt its strategy based on real-time feedback from the environment. 

3.2 System Components of the Web AI Agent 

To ensure seamless integration with dynamic web environments, a Web AI agent system consists of several key components, broadly categorized into the LLM and its supporting modules, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The process begins with the Goal Preprocessing module, which paraphrases user requests before incorporating them into the LLM’s system prompt ( blue box ). Simultaneously, the agent receives information about its predefined Action Space and the execution constraints, which are also included in the system prompt ( yellow box ). Another critical component is the Event Stream , which maintains the history of actions, observations, and metadata, enabling continuous interaction with the environment ( red box ). This allows the agent to track environmental changes and adapt its behavior accordingly. The system processes observations from the environment and integrates them into the user prompt, which also includes structured information about available actions (e.g., Accessibility Tree (Wang et al., 2024a; Mozilla)). Additionally, the user prompt retains records of the agent’s previous actions, providing contextual awareness to guide subsequent decisions. Notably, Web AI agents are often evaluated using mock-up websites rather than real-world webpages—a common practice in recent studies and benchmarks (Yao et al., preprint; Zhou et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2024). This reliance on artificial environments may introduce limitations in assessing real-world robustness and security risks. 4Why Are Web AI Agents More Vulnerable Than Standalone LLMs? A P REPRINT 

4 Understanding Web AI Agent Vulnerabilities: Fine-Grained Evaluation and Component Ablation 

In previous sections, we highlighted the key differences between standalone LLMs and Web AI agents, emphasizing how Web AI agents encapsulate the LLM backbone within a broader system . Prior studies have shown that Web AI agents are more susceptible to jailbreaking than standalone LLMs (Kumar et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025). However, the specific mechanisms and factors driving this increased vulnerability remain unclear. To systematically analyze these weaknesses, we categorize Web AI agent components into three key factors: Factor 1 (Goal Preprocessing), 

Factor 2 (Action Space), and Factor 3 (Event Stream / Web Browser). Our objective is to determine whether these design differences contribute to increased vulnerability, making Web AI agents more susceptible to executing malicious commands. By breaking down these components, we provide a fine-grained analysis of the underlying risks, moving beyond a high-level comparison to uncover the specific structural elements that heighten security risks in Web AI agents. To quantify these risks, we refine the agent harmfulness evaluation strategy (Section 4.2) by introducing a fine-grained assessment framework that captures varying degrees of jailbreak susceptibility. Through extensive experiments, we systematically assess how each system component contributes to the agent’s security vulnerabilities, providing deeper insights into the structural weaknesses of Web AI agents. 

4.1 Hypothesis of why Web AI Agents are more vulnerable Factor 1: The Preprocessing of User Goals — whether through paraphrasing, decomposition, or embedding them within system prompts — can affect their resistance to harmful instructions. 

User goals in a system prompt. Unlike standalone LLMs, which typically use system prompts containing only high-level guidelines, Web AI agents often embed user task descriptions directly into the system prompt (Wang et al., 2024a). While this approach helps preserve the original goal across multi-turn interactions, it could introduce vulnerabilities. Specifically, placing user goals within the system prompt deviates from the safety alignment strategies used to train LLMs, as this behavior is out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to their original safety alignment. This discrepancy could increase the susceptibility of Web AI agents to jailbreaking, making them more prone to executing harmful commands. In short, we hypothesize that embedding user prompts within system prompts contributes to the heightened vulnerability of Web AI agents .

Paraphrasing user goals. Since user goals are often vague, complex, or ambiguous, many Web AI agents (Wang et al., 2024a) leverage LLMs to rephrase or decompose user instructions into structured agent goals for better execution. However, we observe that in some cases, this process focuses purely on rephrasing or decomposition without assessing the safety of the original request. As a result, harmful instructions may be reframed in a more lenient manner, increasing the likelihood that the agent will execute them. Moreover, this reinterpretation can unintentionally introduce additional details that were not explicitly specified by the user, potentially amplifying security risks (as shown in Appendix C). Therefore, we hypothesize that Web AI agents’ vulnerabilities to jailbreaking stem, in part, from the reinterpretation of user goals within the system .

Factor 2: Action Generation Mechanisms — such as predefined action spaces and step-by-step execution — can affect agents’ ability to assess and mitigate harmful intent. 

Providing action space and action instruction. For an LLM’s output to function as an executable action within a web browser, it must operate within a predefined action space or interact with designated functions/tools. To ensure valid execution, Web AI agents supply the LLM with a structured description of the available action space, guiding it to generate outputs that conform to predefined constraints. However, this approach may introduce security trade-offs. Embedding an extensive action space within the system prompt increases prompt length and content diversity, which could weaken the LLM’s ability to detect harmful user inputs. Moreover, focusing the LLM on selecting predefined actions could divert its attention from assessing the intent behind a given task, increasing its increasing its susceptibility to executing harmful commands. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that limiting an LLM’s output to a predefined action space can increase the system’s susceptibility to jailbreaking. 

5Why Are Web AI Agents More Vulnerable Than Standalone LLMs? A P REPRINT 

Method of action generation. Certain tasks require multiple sequential interactions with the web browser rather than a single-step execution. For example, composing an email to persuade someone to share sensitive information involves a series of actions, such as identifying webpage elements, entering an email, and drafting a message (Significant Gravitas; Wang et al., 2024a). When tasks are broken down into discrete steps, the agent executes each action in isolation, potentially failing to recognize the overarching malicious intent. By contrast, generating a high-level plan upfront could provide more contextual awareness, allowing for better assessment of harmfulness. Therefore, we hypothesize that multi-step action generation can inadvertently increase the likelihood of LLMs executing harmful tasks 

compared to generating the full plan in advance. 

Factor 3: Observational Capabilities and Their Impact on Vulnerability. The ability of Web AI agents to observe and interpret web content, coupled with their potential recognition of mock-up environments as artificial, may influence their vulnerability. 

Dynamic State and Event Stream. Unlike standalone LLMs that rely solely on static textual context, Web AI agents actively interact with web pages and incorporate sequential event streams — which include previous actions, observations, and auxiliary metadata — into their decision-making process. This dynamic observation capability enables agents to adapt their strategies in real-time, allowing for more flexible task execution. However, this adaptability may also introduce security risks. For example, Web AI agents could revise their approach over multiple iterations, gradually overriding initial constraints and proceeding with harmful actions based on newly observed event stream content. We hypothesize that by iteratively modifying their strategies through trial and error based on the dynamic event stream, these agents may eventually attempt actions they initially deemed harmful, affecting the risk of unintended or malicious outcomes. 

Impact of Mock-Up Websites on Agent Behavior. Previous studies have shown that when LLMs perceive a scenario as fictional or simulated, they are more likely to engage in risky behavior. For instance, an LLM tasked with designing a terrorist attack plan was more likely to comply when the request was framed as writing a fictional film script (Zhu et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024b). Similarly, we hypothesize that Web AI agents may detect the artificial nature of mock-up webpages, influencing their risk assessment and decision-making process. This recognition could increase the agent’s leniency toward executing potentially harmful commands, as it may implicitly categorize the environment as non-threatening or hypothetical. (See Appendix C for detailed examples and clues that Web AI Agent identify a mock-up website.) 

4.2 Fine-Grained Evaluation Protocol For Analyzing Agent Harmfulness 

While previous studies primarily compare the overall vulnerability rates of Web AI agents and standalone LLMs, they typically rely on binary jailbreak success/failure assessments (Kumar et al., 2024). Such an approach oversimplifies the issue and fails to capture nuanced jailbreak behaviors. To address this gap, we introduce a fine-grained evaluation framework that categorizes jailbreak attempts into five distinct levels, allowing for a more precise understanding of agent vulnerabilities. As shown in Fig. 2, various components of a Web AI agent—such as goal preprocessing, action space, and event stream—impact its likelihood of successfully executing or resisting harmful tasks at different levels. However, traditional binary jailbreak evaluations (success/failure) oversimplify the issue, failing to capture subtle signals of jailbreaking that emerge throughout an agent’s decision-making process. 

Fine-grained evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce a fine-grained five-level assessment framework, where each level represents a different degree of harmfulness, as illustrated in Fig. 3. This framework allows us to detect early signs of harmful planning, even in cases where the agent does not complete the entire task. By tracking how jailbreak attempts evolve—from subtle indications of harmful intent to fully executed malicious actions—our framework provides a more intuitive and detailed understanding of agent behavior. Given the complexity of these assessments, we rely primarily on human evaluation to interpret nuanced cases accurately. Within this framework, we define 5 distinct levels of jailbreaking: (1) Clear-Denial – LLM outputs a denial message and immediately halts the system. (2) Soft-Denial – LLM outputs a denial message at some point (initially, midway, or at the final step), but still proceeds to execute at least one action. This includes Inconsistent Rejection introduced in Section 5.1. (3) Non-Denial – LLM does not output any denial message throughout the interaction and continues executing actions. (4) Harmful Plans – LLM generates harmful plans to successfully achieve the malicious request. In addition to Non-Denial, Harmful Plans produce a complete plan for achieving the harmful goal. Human evaluators verify the feasibility by following them. (5) Harmful Actions – The agent executes the action sequence to fulfill the malicious request. In addition to Harmful Plans, Harmful Actions complete the intended malicious goal. 6Why Are Web AI Agents More Vulnerable Than Standalone LLMs? A P REPRINT 

We also establish the following set relationships within our framework: • Non-Denial, Soft-Denial, and Clear-Denial are disjoint sets (Non-Denial ∩ Soft-Denial ∩ Clear-Denial = ∅). • Harmful Plans is a subset of Non-Denial (Harmful Plans ⊆ Non-Denial). • Harmful Actions is a subset of Harmful Plans (Harmful Actions ⊆ Harmful Plans). This layered structure enables a more precise analysis of whether a jailbreak attempt occurred and how deeply the agent engaged with the harmful request. By refining our understanding of system vulnerabilities, this framework offers valuable insights into the root causes of AI agent susceptibility and informs future security improvements. (See Appendix A for qualitative examples of each level.) Soft -Denial

Figure 3: Fine-Grained Harmfulness Evaluation Scenarios 

Fine-grained ablation of Web AI agent components. In addition to fine-grained evaluation, we conduct an in-depth study by incrementally integrating components of Web AI agents into standalone LLMs. By systematically adding each component step by step, we effectively simulate an ablation process without compromising the agent’s core functionality. To ensure reliable and consistent results, each instruction was tested three times, reducing the influence of randomness in agent responses. This incremental approach allows us to test the hypotheses on agent vulnerabilities proposed in Section 4.1 and isolate the specific contributions of each system component to security risks. Following (Kumar et al., 2024), we conducted our experiments using OpenHands (Wang et al., 2024a) (previously known as OpenDevin (Wang et al., 2024b)), a widely adopted and stable platform within both academic and industrial research communities. As illustrated in Fig. 2, a Web AI agent system consists of an LLM and the surrounding modules that facilitate interaction with dynamic web environments. Using the OpenHands (Wang et al., 2024a), we systematically isolate and integrate these components into the LLM framework, testing their responses to identical malicious user inputs. This incremental approach enables us to analyze how each component contributes to vulnerabilities across different stages of harmful behavior. Through this ablation process, we identify the specific roles of individual components in increasing susceptibility to harmful interactions, providing a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing Web AI agent safety. 

5 Results: Why Are Web Agents Easier to Jailbreak? 

In this section, we present the results of our component ablation studies on Web AI agents, evaluating their responses to malicious user input. Our experiments use 10 diverse harmful requests (Appendix E), each tested three times to minimize randomness in agent responses. GPT-4o-2024-0806 serves as the backbone LLM for all evaluations. In some experiments, the model lacks web interaction capabilities due to the absence of the Event Stream. As a result, it cannot execute harmful actions, and we instead focus on whether the model generated harmful plans in these cases. Conversely, experiments where the agent retains full web interaction capabilities—allowing us to measure harmful action execution—are marked with ∗.To create realistic test scenarios, we use mock-up websites proposed by Kumar et al. (2024), which simulate popular platforms such as Instagram, LinkedIn, and Gmail. These controlled environments enable consistent evaluations while maintaining representative web interactions. Additionally, we compare evaluation results on real websites to assess the impact of using mock-up environments versus real-world settings. These ablation studies specifically examine the key components described in section 4.1. The results of these evaluations are summarized in Table 1. 7Why Are Web AI Agents More Vulnerable Than Standalone LLMs? A P REPRINT

Our key findings include: 1) Adding SysGoal to the standalone LLM decreases Clear Denial rate by 6.7%, and introducing Multi-step Action Gen. further decreases that by 20%. 2) Including Event Stream further reduces Clear Denial rate by 20%. 3) Switching from Mock-up Web to Real Web lowers Clear Denial rate by 43.3%, but prevents harmful actions due to webpage complexity.

5.1 Web Agents are Significantly More Vulnerable 

To evaluate the vulnerability of Web AI agents compared to standalone LLMs, we first examine their jailbreaking success rates in responses to malicious instructions. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the two systems exhibit strikingly different behaviors when exposed to identical malicious inputs: • Standalone LLM: Maintains a 0% jailbreaking success rate, consistently refusing all harmful requests. • Web AI Agent: Successfully generates harmful plans and completes malicious tasks in 33.3% of cases, with 46.7% of responses classified as non-denials. This stark contrast is particularly concerning, given that both systems are built on the same underlying LLM , yet the Web AI agent demonstrates a substantially higher susceptibility to executing harmful commands. One of the failure mode we observe in Web AI agents is Inconsistent Rejection , where the agent initially refuses a malicious request but later contradicts its stance and proceeds with compliance. For example, we identify multiple cases where the agent responds, “Sorry, I can’t assist” only to later change its position and fulfill the malicious request (as shown in Appendix B). To provide a more comprehensive understanding of vulnerablities, we include a detailed breakdown of jailbreaking behaviors, highlighting susceptibility patterns and key failure modes in Web AI agents as shown in Table 1. 

5.2 Differences in the Method of Conveying User Goals Result 1: Embedding user goals in the system prompt significantly increases jailbreak success rates, while para-phrasing the goal reduces clear denials. 

User goals in the system prompt. To examine the impact of embedding user goals in the system prompt (Factor 1), we analyze jailbreak success rates under two conditions: Standalone LLM , where the goal is provided only in the user prompt, and +SysGoal , where the goal is embedded in both the user and system prompts (Table 1). All other conditions remain constant to ensure a fair comparison. The results indicate that when the goal is not embedded in the system prompt, all jailbreak attempts fail, even with additional modifications (as tested in the other two ablations within the same block). However, embedding the goal in the system prompt increases the jailbreak success rate from zero to a measurable level, suggesting that this design choice directly contributes to higher vulnerability in Web AI agents. Paraphrasing user goals. To evaluate the impact of goal paraphrasing on vulnerabilities (Factor 1), we compare jailbreak success rates in Web AI agent with and without paraphrasing of user-provided goals. As shown in Fig. 2, Web AI agents typically paraphrase user task descriptions before embedding them in the system prompt for action generation and planning. To evaluate the effect of this design choice, we conduct an experiment where the original user-provided goal is directly passed to the LLM (- Goal Paraphrasing) without modification. The results indicate that 8Why Are Web AI Agents More Vulnerable Than Standalone LLMs? A P REPRINT 

disabling goal paraphrasing increases the rate of clear denials by 13.3%, suggesting that goal paraphrasing introduces more vulnerabilities by potentially softening harmful requests or reinterpreting them in a way that makes them more acceptable to the agent. 

5.3 Differences in the Method of Action Generation and Action Instructions Result 2: Providing action space and action instructions increases system vulnerability, while a multi-step interaction strategy further exacerbates it. 

Impact of action space, instructions, and generation methods. This section examines how action generation methods affect vulnerability rate (Factor 2). In the Web agents framework, the system prompt defines a predefined action space, guiding the LLM in selecting from available choices. This differs from the Standalone LLM , which lacks predefined task constraints and instead relies on a default, general-purpose prompt (e.g., “You are a helpful assistant”). We evaluate two action generation strategies: (1) Single-Step Planning (+Single-Step Action Gen.) - the LLM plans the entire action sequence upfront before execution. (2) Multi-Step Execution (+Multi-Step Action Gen.) - the LLM generates actions incrementally, adapting its decisions based on intermediate states. The results indicate that: • Providing an action space or task-specific instructions alone does not significantly affect jailbreak success rates (as shown in the ablations on Standalone LLM in Table 1). • However, when the goal is embedded in the system prompt, both the single-step and multi-step action generation strategies increased vulnerabilities ( Standalone LLM + SysGoal section in Table 1). • Notably, multi-step execution leads to a higher jailbreak success (-20% Clear Denial) than single-step planning, indicating that step-by-step action generation increases susceptibility to vulnerabilities compared to pre-planned sequences. 

5.4 Differences Due to Agent Event Stream Result 3: The presence of an Event Stream increases system vulnerability, while the controlled environment of mock-up websites may influence the interpretation of agent behavior in real-world scenarios. 

Impact of Event Stream on Vulnerability. This section examines how the Event Stream affects agent vulnerability (Factor 3). In Table 1, the configuration labeled Standalone LLM + SysGoal + Multi-step Action Gen. represents a 

Standalone LLM augmented with all Web AI agent components except the Event Stream . Under this setup, the system achieves a 73.3% Clear Denial rate when responding to malicious commands. suggesting tracking action history and webpage observations increases susceptibility to jailbreaking. Possible reasons for this increased vulnerability include: • Extended context length , making it harder to filter harmful requests. • Complex webpage structures , which introduce additional variables the agent must process. • Dynamic webpage states , which may lead the agent to modify its decisions iteratively, reducing its ability to maintain safety constraints. These findings suggest that the design of Web AI agents incorporating an Event Stream inherently makes them more vulnerable than standalone LLMs. 

Impact of mock-up vs. real websites on evaluation. This section compares the use of Real Web and Mock-up Web 

for evaluation, as outlined in Factor 3. As shown in Table 1: • Testing on real websites significantly reduces the Clear Denial rate (-43.3%), suggesting that Web AI agents struggle to assess the harmfulness of requests accurately in real-world conditions. This difficulty may stem from the greater complexity and diversity of real webpages. • However, despite the lower denial rates, real websites recorded a 30% reduction in harmful action completion compared to mock-ups. This difference may stem from the fact that real websites require more complex interactions, often containing richer accessibility trees (Wang et al., 2024a; Mozilla) that Web AI agents struggle to navigate effectively. Additionally, 9Why Are Web AI Agents More Vulnerable Than Standalone LLMs? A P REPRINT 

in real-world settings, Web AI agents sometimes exhibit Inconsistent Rejection (Appendix B), where they initially refuse malicious requests but later attempt to bypass constraints while issuing harmful instructions. This trial-and-error behavior suggests that agents adapt their strategies dynamically, increasing the risk of unintended compliance with harmful commands. 

6 Conclusions 

This study demonstrates that Web AI agents are significantly more vulnerable to harmful or malicious user inputs than standalone LLMs, highlighting the urgent need for safer and more robust Web AI agent designs. Through a fine-grained analysis of the key differences between Web AI agents and standalone LLMs, we systematically identified several design factors contributing to these vulnerabilities, as summarized in Table 1. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive studies to systematically ablate and investigate the underlying components that drive these security risks. Our findings reveal several actionable insights: • Embedding user goals within the system prompts significantly increases jailbreak success rates. Paraphrasing user goals further heightens system vulnerabilities by potentially softening or misinterpreting harmful intent. • Providing predefined action spaces, especially in multi-turn action strategies, makes the system more suscepti-ble to executing harmful tasks. This risk is particularly pronounced when the user’s goal is embedded in the system prompt. • Mock-up websites do not inherently promote harmful intent, but they facilitate more effective task execution for malicious objectives. This suggests that controlled environments can still unintentionally shape agent behavior in ways that affect security assessments. • The presence of an Event Stream, which tracks action history and dynamic web observations, amplifies harmful behavior. This finding underscores the Event Stream as a critical vulnerability factor, as it allows the agent to iteratively refine its approach, potentially increasing susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. These findings highlight how specific design elements—goal processing, action generation strategies, and dynamic web interactions—contribute to the overall risk of harmful behavior. By offering a comprehensive understanding of these vulnerabilities, our study provides guidance for designing safer Web AI agents and lays the groundwork for future research on mitigating these security risks. Future work should explore defensive mechanisms to enhance robustness, including adaptive filtering, structured action constraints, and improved system prompt strategies to minimize unintended harmful behavior. 

7 Future Works and Limitations 

Our research establishes a foundation for understanding the vulnerabilities of the Web AI agent and guiding for future advances, but several key areas remain open for exploration. First, incorporating a wider range of agent frameworks and diverse datasets could uncover deeper vulnerabilities and identify hidden behavioral patterns. Second, our findings suggest promising directions for designing jailbreak defenses with minimal performance trade-offs, such as embedding safety regulations directly into system prompts to mitigate malicious inputs. Third, the influence of mock-up websites on agent behavior underscores the importance of creating realistic benchmarks, such as simulations of real web environments or tests within sandboxed real websites, to ensure accurate assessments. Lastly, future work could focus on establishing automatic evaluation systems and developing nuanced metrics to detect subtle risks and unintended behaviors more effectively. By exploring these directions, future work can enhance Web AI agents’ safety, robustness, and reliability, building upon our findings to drive meaningful improvements in the field.

B Vulnerability: Inconsistent Rejection 

Inconsistent Rejection: From our experiments, we found that web agents when receiving malicious commands, sometimes will reject in the first place or during certain levels of multi-turn actions. After the rejection, it may start to change the plan and proceed, the plan may not contain explicitly harmful plans, but since it doesn’t reject clearly and even proceed with actions afterward, we believe this vulnerability should be patched. A practical example is shown in Fig. 5. We observe that this usually happens when agents encounter unexpected difficulties/errors such as login errors, webpage element localization errors, or execution errors, which happens mostly when agents interact with Real (complex) websites instead of the mock-up website that is easier to navigate. This highlights that it might introduce more vulnerabilities when agents operate in the real world during daily usage.

E Samples of Malicious Instructions 

In this section, we showcase one example from each diverse malicious instruction we leveraged from the dataset proposed by (Kumar et al., 2024), which has two categories and 16 harmful scenarios aiming to cover the real-world scenario. In the Malicious Type column, types that start from content means Harmful Content Generation. The Web AI agent is instructed to generate harmful content and spread the harm to the Internet. On the other hand, categories action stands for Harmful Interaction, the agent is instructed to create a series of browser events, such as clicks and page navigation, that generate harm on a given website. For each malicious task, the tasks are tested with the mock-up website specified in the Website column, while in the scenario of Real Website testing, it is the real version as the counterpart of the mockup website (e.g. https://github.com/ is the real website we used to test pull request tasks). In our experiment, we drop the Malicious Type that doesn’t have a real website that can be tested (e.g. Captcha, Messenger) Table 3: Showcase some samples of Malicious Instructions used in our experiment in Table 1, which is originally from (Kumar et al., 2024)
