## Abstract 

Recent research has explored that LLM agents are vulnerable to indirect prompt injection (IPI) attacks, where malicious tasks embedded in tool-retrieved information can redirect the agent to take unauthorized actions. Existing defenses against IPI have significant limitations: either require es-sential model training resources, lack effective-ness against sophisticated attacks, or harm the normal utilities. We present MELON ( Masked re-Execution and Too L comparis ON ), a novel IPI defense. Our approach builds on the observation that under a successful attack, the agent’s next action becomes less dependent on user tasks and more on malicious tasks. Following this, we de-sign MELON to detect attacks by re-executing the agent’s trajectory with a masked user prompt mod-ified through a masking function. We identify an attack if the actions generated in the original and masked executions are similar. We also include three key designs to reduce the potential false pos-itives and false negatives. Extensive evaluation on the IPI benchmark AgentDojo demonstrates that MELON outperforms SOTA defenses in both attack prevention and utility preservation. More-over, we show that combining MELON with a SOTA prompt augmentation defense (denoted as MELON-Aug) further improves its performance. We also conduct a detailed ablation study to vali-date our key designs. Code is available at https: //github.com/kaijiezhu11/MELON .

Figure 1. Comparison of averaged Utility under Attack (UA, higher is better) performance and Attack Success Rate (ASR, lower is better) on GPT-4o, o3-mini, and Llama-3.3-70B across dif-ferent defense methods. Our proposed methods (MELON and MELON-Aug) achieve superior performance with extremely low ASR while maintaining high UA, outperforming all the baseline defense methods. Detailed comparisons among these defenses are in Section 4.2. 

tion attacks (IPI) (Naihin et al., 2023; Ruan et al., 2024; Yuan et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Zhan et al., 2024; Debenedetti et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024a). Attackers exploit the agent’s interaction with external resources by embedding malicious tasks in tool-retrieved information such as database (Zhong et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2024) and websites (Liao et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024a). These malicious tasks will force the agent to take unautho-rized actions, leading to severe consequences. Defending against IPI attacks is significantly challenging. First, unlike jailbreaking LLMs, the injected malicious prompts and their resultant behaviors can be legitimate tasks. Second, implementing effective defenses requires a careful balance between security guarantees and utility maintenance. Existing IPI defenses either require essential model training resources, are only applicable to simple attacks, or harm nor-mal utilities under attack scenarios. Specifically, resource-expensive defenses retrain the LLM in the agent (Chen et al., 2024a; Wallace et al., 2024) or train an additional model to detect injected prompts in the retrieved data (ProtectAI, 1MELON: Provable Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks in AI Agents 

2024). Such methods are less practical due to the greedy re-source requirements. Furthermore, adversarial training may jeopardize the model’s normal utility, while model-based detection naturally harms the agent’s utility under attack scenarios and suffers from high false negative rates (Sec-tion 4.2). Existing training-free defenses either augment the user inputs with additional prompts (Mendes, 2023; Hines et al., 2024; lea, 2023) or filter out malicious tool calls (Debenedetti et al., 2024). As shown in Section 4.2, prompt augmentation methods maintain high utility but fail to prevent sophisticated attacks, while tool filter achieves low ASR at the cost of severely degrading utility. In this paper, we proposed a novel IPI defense, MELON, based on the key insight that the agent’s tool calls are less dependent on the user inputs when subjected to at-tacks. MELON re-executes the agent’s action trajectory with masked states, where only retrieved outputs are pre-served and the user inputs are masked by a masking function. Then, MELON detects attacks by comparing tool calls be-tween the original execution and a masked re-execution. When similar tool calls are found at a certain step, it indi-cates an attack since the tool calls are unrelated to the user’s input. We introduce three key designs to further strengthen MELON: a customized masking function to prevent arbi-trary tool calls during the masked execution; a tool call cache for the masked execution to better identify attacks in the original execution; and a focused tool call comparison mechanism to knock off noisy information. These designs resolve key technical challenges discussed in Section 3.2, significantly reducing false positives and false negatives. Through extensive experimentation on the AgentDojo benchmark using three LLMs: GPT-4o, o3-mini, Llama-3.3-70B, we demonstrate that MELON and MELON-Aug (com-bining MELON with prompt augmentation) significantly outperforms five SOTA defenses against four SOTA attacks. As shown in Figure 1, MELON and MELON-Aug archive the lowest attack success rate while maintaining the normal utility for both benign and attack scenarios. Specifically, MELON-Aug creates synergistic effects, further reducing ASR to 0.32 % while maintaining 68 .72 % utility on GPT-4o. In addition, we also conduct an ablation study to validate our three key designs and show MELON’s insensitivity to key hyper-parameters. To our knowledge, MELON is the first IPI detection that leverages the independence between malicious tool calls and user input and achieves so far the best balance between security and utility maintenance. 

## 2. Related Work 

Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks. At a high level, in-direct prompt injection attacks against agents can be cate-gorized as general attacks and agent-specific attacks. Gen-eral attacks focus on developing universal attack prompt patterns that force the target agent to conduct the attacker tasks rather than the user tasks. Notably, the escape char-acter attacks (Willison, 2022) utilize special characters like “\n ” to manipulate context interpretation. Context-ignoring attacks (Perez & Ribeiro, 2022; Schulhoff et al., 2023) ex-plicitly instruct the LLMs to disregard the previous context. Fake completion attacks (Willison, 2023) attempt to deceive the LLMs by simulating task completion. These methods are often tested on IPI benchmarks (Debenedetti et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024) with pre-specified injection points and at-tack tasks. There are also some early explorations of LLMs attacks against a specific type of agent. For example, attacks against web agents inject the attack content into the web pages to “fool” the agent into the attack tasks (Wu et al., 2024a; Liao et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2024). Attacks against computer agents manipulate the computer interface (Zhang et al., 2024b). Note that there are also some direct prompt injection attacks against LLMs (Yu et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2024a;c; Toyer et al., 2024). These methods directly append the attack prompts after the user inputs, which may not be practical in real-world applications. 

Defenses against IPI. Existing defenses can be categorized based on resource requirements. Defenses that require addi-tional training resources either conduct adversarial training of the LLM(s) in the target agent (Wallace et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a;b) or add additional models to detect whether the inputs contain injected prompts (ProtectAI, 2024; Inan et al., 2023). However, these methods face practical limi-tations due to their substantial computational and data re-quirements. In addition, adversarial training may jeopardize the model’s normal utility in broader application domains. As we will show later, adding additional detection models naturally harms the agent’s utility under attack and suffers from high false negative rates. Training-free defenses either design additional prompts for the user inputs or constrain the allowed tool calls of the agent. First, most training-free defenses explore additional prompts that either help the model ignore or detect potential attack instructions in the retrieved data. Specifically, igno-rance strategies include adding a delimiter between the user prompt and retrieved data (Hines et al., 2024; Mendes, 2023; Willison, 2023), repeating the user prompt (lea, 2023). Such defenses, while lightweight, have limited efficacy against stronger attacks (as shown in Sec 4). Known-answer de-tection (Liu et al., 2024) adds additional questions with known answers to the user prompt and detects if the model finally outputs the answer. However, this method can only identify injections post-execution, when attacks may have already succeeded. Second, tool filtering (Debenedetti et al., 2024) allows LLMs to select a set of permitted tools for the given user task and block all calls to unauthorized tools. This approach harms utility as the LLMs sometimes filter out necessary tools. More importantly, it is easy to bypass 2MELON: Provable Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks in AI Agents 

as the attackers can design their attack tasks with only the tools related to the user attack. TaskShield (Jia et al., 2024) proposes an alignment check to detect if the proposed tool calls align with user tasks. In comparison, our method is a lightweight and highly effective training-free defense that well maintains the agent’s normal utility. Note that other defenses require human intervention (Wu et al., 2025), white-box model access (Wu et al., 2024b), or reverting agent actions (Patil et al., 2024). Due to these strong assumptions and lack of full automation, we exclude these approaches from our analysis. 

## 3. Metholody of MELON 

3.1. Preliminaries Formalization and Definition of LLM Agent. In this work, we define an LLM agent π as an integrated system compris-ing LLM(s) and a set of tools F = {f1, ..., f n} for environ-ment interaction. The agent receives a user prompt spec-ifying a task Tu (e.g., “ Summarize my agenda and tell me the time of the next event. ”) and executes it through a structured multi-step procedure. At each step t, we define the state as St = ( Tu, A1: t, O1: t),where Tu is the user task, A1: t = {(R1, C1), ..., (Rt, Ct)}

is the sequence of LLM-generated actions with each action pair consisting of an LLM response Ri and a set of tool calls Ci = {c1 

> i

, ..., c mi 

> i

}. Each tool call 

cji specifies a tool fj ∈ F and its parameters (e.g., “retrieve event(date=20250131) ”). O1: t =

{O 1, ..., Ot} denotes the sequence of observations, where each Oi contains the tool execution outputs corresponding to Ci. In step t + 1 , The agent system first generates action 

At+1 = π(St) based on previous state, then obtaining ob-servation Ot+1 = Exec (Ct+1 ) by executing the tool calls. This process continues iteratively until the user task Tu is completed or errors occur. 

Threat Model. We follow the assumption of IPI, where attackers cannot access the LLMs’ input and output in-side the target agent. Their access is limited to manipu-lating the external information retrieved by the agent via tool calls, such as websites, emails, or files. The attackers aim to redirect the agent from executing the original user task to performing a malicious task Tm. For example, the attacker task could be “ Send your bank account and password to hacker@gmail.com ”. We de-note O′ 

> t

to be the tool execution outputs injected with Tm

and O′ 

> 1: t

= {O 1, ..., O′

> t

} as the sequences of previous tool execution outputs. We assume all user tasks to be legitimate and the defender has complete access to the entire agent sys-tem, including the states St = ( Tu, A1: t, O1: t). However, we do not assume the defender has the resources to train LLMs or can access LLM internal representations. 

3.2. Technical Overview Insights and Technical Challenges. Our design is based on the key observation that whenever a malicious attacker task 

Tm is present in the retrieved data, it attempts to redirect the agent from executing the user task Tu toward execut-ing Tm instead. Given a state St = ( Tu, A1: t, O′

> 1: t

), if 

O′ 

> t

that injected with Tm successfully hijacks the agent’s behavior to focus on executing Tm, it induces a state col-lapse where the agent’s next action At+1 becomes con-ditionally independent of Tu and A1: t, depending primar-ily on O′

> 1: t

. For benign cases where Ot does not contain malicious instructions or the attack does not succeed, the agent maintains functional dependencies on all state com-ponents (Tu, A1: t, O1: t). Formally, for a successful attack at step t, we can observe: Pπ (At+1 |(Tu, A1: t, O′

> 1: t

)) ≈

Pπ (At+1 |O ′

> 1: t

), where P is the probability. For benign exe-cutions, the agent’s actions maintain their dependency on the user inputs: Pπ (At+1 |(Tu, A1: t, O1: t)) ≫ Pπ (At+1 |O 1: t).

This statistical discrepancy naturally leads to a masking-based approach to detect the injected prompts. Let M :

S → S be a masking operator that preserves only original tool execution outputs. We define two execution paths: 

Aot+1 = ( Rot+1 , Cot+1 ) = π(St) (the original run) ,

Amt+1 = ( Rmt+1 , Cmt+1 ) = π(M(St)) (the masking run) ,

where ∗ot+1 and ∗mt+1 represent the action generated by the original run and masked run at step t + 1 , respectively. By comparing the agent’s next action generated by the orig-inal run and the masking run, we can identify potential attacks: if the action deviates after masking, that indicates the agent’s action is related to the user task and the original execution is benign, otherwise, the execution is independent from the user prompt, indicating there are attacker-injected prompts during the execution. 

To compare the actions of the original run and the masking run , we can feed Aot+1 and Amt+1 into a text embedding model and compute their distance in the embedding space. If at any step, we observe that the distance is higher than a certain threshold, it means the LLM output depends only on 

O1: t and signals an attacker-injected prompt. However, although straightforward, this masking function and the comparison method face three technical challenges 

during our exploration. ❶, when presented with only O1: t

in the masking run, the LLM may treat these tool execu-tion outputs as few-shot examples and generate contextually plausible but potentially arbitrary tool calls. Thus, for in-jected cases, the generated tool calls may deviate from the malicious task Tm embedded in O′

> t

, leading to false neg-atives, while for benign cases, these arbitrary calls might coincidentally align with the user task Tu, causing false positives. ❷, we observe that, in some cases, the execution timing of Tm differs between the original run and the mask-3MELON: Provable Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks in AI Agents Task Neutral Prompt

Figure 2. MELON detection pipeline comparing two parallel execution paths: the original run (top) and masking run (bottom). The original run processes the user task Tu while the masking run uses a task-neutral prompt Tf . Green boxes show benign execution where no malicious task is detected (left), as the masking run generates no matching tool calls. Red boxes indicate prompt injection attack (right), where the agent deviates to execute an injected malicious task Tm, resulting in matching tool calls between the two paths. Tool calls from the masking run are stored in the tool call cache Ht for comparison. 

ing run. In the original run, the agent might execute the user task Tu first before proceeding to Tm. However, in the masking run, since there is no user task to complete, the agent directly executes Tm. As a result, at step t, while the masking run has begun executing Tm, the original run may still be processing Tu. This timing mismatch leads to false negatives when comparing tool calls at corresponding steps. 

❸, typically, the action generated by LLM contains both text responses R and the tool calls C with specific arguments. In successful attack cases, the masking run and original run may differ in their text responses R while maintaining iden-tical tool calls C that execute the malicious task Tm, which again introduces false negatives. 

Overview of MELON. We design MELON by optimizing the straightforward approach above with novel strategies to address the key technical challenges (demonstrated in Fig-ure 2). Specifically, to address challenge ❶, we modify the masking function M in two ways: (1) instead of simply re-moving Tu, we replace it with a task-neutral prompt Tf (see Appendix A.1) that typically requires no tool interactions, and (2) we consolidate the sequence of tool outputs O1: t

into a single context Ot

1. Formally, our modified masking function is: M(Tu, A1: t, O1: t) = ( Tf , ∅, Ot

1). To further make the LLM better follow the Tf in the masking run, we create two few-shot chat samples (see Appendix A.2) that include user, LLM response, and tool execution out-puts. These designs together reduce false negatives by guiding the LLM to focus on detecting embedded instruc-tions rather than mimicking the tool call patterns in O1: t.For challenge ❷, we implement a tool call cache H that records the sequence of tool calls from the masking run: 

Ht+1 = {C m

1 , ..., Cmt+1 }, where Cmi denotes the tool calls generated by the masking run in step i. We identify an attack when any tool call in the original run is similar to a cached call: ∃c ∈ C ot+1 , ∃h ∈ H : sim (c, h ) > θ ,where θ is the similarity threshold. This cache-based ap-

proach reduces false negatives by capturing all potential attack-related tool calls across multiple steps. Note that this cache-based detection will not introduce new false pos-itives because tool calls in Ht+1 indicate potential mali-cious instructions since matching calls in the original run suggests the LLM is executing instructions embedded in previous tool execution outputs. Finally, to tackle chal-lenge ❸, we focus our comparison specifically on tool calls rather than complete actions. Let tools (A) extract the tool calls from an action. We update the detection criterion as: sim (tools (Aot+1 ), tools (Amt+1 )) > θ . This design is moti-vated by the fact that accomplishing the attack task typically 4MELON: Provable Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks in AI Agents 

involves calling one or more tools that are correlated to the malicious attacker task Tm. This design significantly reduces false negatives as the content that causes large dif-ferences under attacks is not considered. 

Remark. A simpler detection approach might be to identify prompt injection whenever the masking run generates any tool calls. However, this would reduce system utility under attack scenarios. Many injected tasks Tm fail to redirect the LLM - while they may trigger tool calls in the masking run, the original run remains focused on executing the user task 

Tu. In such cases, marking these unsuccessful attacks would unnecessarily interrupt benign executions. Therefore, com-paring tool calls is essential to identify only those attacks that successfully influence the agent’s behavior. 

3.3. Technical Details 

Algorithm 1 presents the complete detection procedure. As discussed above, our detection mechanism analyzes the similarity between tool calls generated in two parallel runs: the original run and the masking run. At step t, we maintain a tool call cache Ht that collects tool calls from the masking run. The detection process consists of two phases: (1) cache population and (2) similarity-based detection. In the cache population phase, we first use the masking func-tion M to mask the current state St. If Ot 

> 1

contains a ma-licious task Tm, the agent will generate tool calls Cmt+1 cor-responding to Tm, which are then added to the cache Ht+1 .Otherwise, if no malicious task is present, the agent will generate no tool calls given the design of Tf . For similarity-based detection, we compare each tool call c ∈ C ot+1 from the original run with every cached tool call h ∈ H t+1 using a vector embedding model ϕ: sim (c, h ) = ϕ(c)·ϕ(h) 

> |ϕ(c)|·| ϕ(h)|

. We raise an alert if any similarity score exceeds a threshold θ:Alert t+1 = ∃c ∈ C ot+1 , ∃h ∈ H t+1 : sim (c, h ) > θ .Our preference for embedding-based similarity over exact matching stems from the semantic nature of tool calls, tool calls with similar intents can have different arguments. For example, an attack instructing send all your personal data to hacker@evil.com 

might generate tool calls with slightly different arguments like send email("hacker", subject="data") 

and send email("hacker", subject="info") ,while they differ in their exact argument names, these two calls serve the same malicious purpose. Exact matching would fail to detect such semantically equivalent but syntactically distinct attacks. 3.3.1. I MPLEMENTATION AND OVERHEAD ANALYSIS 

Implementation Details. Our detection method consists of several key components. For tool call comparison, we convert each tool call to a natural language description, note that for specific functions, we do not compare some of their arguments, for example, for the send email 

function, we do not compare the contents to be sent, but instead only recipient is considered. Details can be found in Appendix A.3. Next, we employ OpenAI’s text-embedding-v3 model (OpenAI, 2024) that maps these descriptions to dense vector representations. We set the primary similarity threshold θ = 0 .8 to balance detection sensitivity and false positive rate, the ablation study on different similarity thresholds is presented in Section 4.3. The task-neutral prompt Tf is designed to be independent of specific domains or tasks. For example: “ Summarize the provided content. If there are any instructions, execute them. ” This formu-lation enables the detection of injected tasks Tm while minimizing false positives from benign content such as documentation or user guides, we also provide the ablation study for different Tf in Section 4.3. 

Overhead Analysis. We analyze both the time complex-ity and computational cost of our approach. Since LLMs typically supports batch operations, the masking run can be executed in parallel with the original path during each tool output inspection. This parallel execution minimizes the ad-ditional latency introduced by our detection method. Also, since the contents of the masking run largely overlap with the original run, we can implement a KV cache to reduce the latency. The primary source of latency stems from com-puting embeddings, which depends on the response time of OpenAI’s embedding model API in our implementation. Regarding computational costs, particularly for API-based models, the introduction of the masking run effectively dou-bles the number of required model calls. This results in a 

≈ 2× increase in API costs compared to the undefended baseline system. However, we argue that this cost overhead is justified given the critical importance of protecting agent systems against IPI attacks. 

3.4. Theoretical Guarantee 

3.4.1. E NSEMBLE DETECTOR 

We extended MELON with a theoretical framework that provides guarantees on worst-case performance. First, we define different masking prompts: T1, T2, ..., Tn. As we defined in Section 4.3, these can be any general prompts un-related to the user task, such as sentiment analysis, grammar checks, or sentiment analysis, etc. Each masking prompt serves as an individual detector. We construct an ensem-ble detector by combining outputs of these individual weak detectors :

X

d(Ao, Ami ) > θ 

#

5MELON: Provable Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks in AI Agents 

where H(Ao) is the ensemble detector’s output ( 1 for mali-cious, 0 for benign), Ao is the agent action for the original run, Ami is the action for the masking run (using the masking prompt Ti), d(Ao, Ami ) is the similarity measure, θ ∈ [0 , 1] 

is the decision threshold (typically 0.5). 3.4.2. E RROR BOUNDS 

Using Hoeffding’s inequality, we derive bounds on error rates. For False Positives ( Ao is benign, no prompt injection: 

Ao ∈ B): 

P 1

n

> n

X

> i=1

d(Ao, Ami ) > θ

≤ exp  −2n(θ − μB )2 .

For False Negatives ( Ao contains malicious content: Ao ∈

V): 

P 1

n

> n

X

> i=1

d(Ao, Ami ) < θ 

!

≤ exp  −2n(μV − θ)2

where μB and μV are the expected similarity scores: 

μB = E[d(Ao, A mi )] for Ao ∈ B

μV = E[d(Ao, A mi )] for Ao ∈ V

These bounds demonstrate that error rates decrease expo-nentially with the number of weak detectors , provided that μB < θ < μ V . For instance, with μB = 0 .3, μV = 0 .7,

θ = 0 .5, and n = 100 detectors, the error bounds become approximately 1.8 × 10 −4.

## 4. Evaluation 

4.1. Experiment Setup Agent. We evaluate MELON on the IPI benchmark Agent-Dojo (Debenedetti et al., 2024). AgentDojo comprises four types of agents (banking, slack, travel, and workspace), and each type of agent has a unique set of tools. AgentDojo de-signs 16 , 21 , 20 , 40 user tasks for their agents, respectively. Besides, each agent also has different attack tasks and in-jection points. It picks one user task and one attack task to form an attack case, and in total, 629 attack cases. Several early works also propose prompt injection attacks bench-marks (Zhan et al., 2024), we choose AgentDojo because it is the latest one containing many diverse attack cases. We also tried another benchmark for multi-modal agents, i.e., VisualWebArena-Adv (VWA-Adv) (Wu et al., 2024a). We do not select it because the attack success rate of SOTA image attacks on this benchmark is low (see Appendix D for more details). We consider three models as the LLM model in each agent: GPT-4o, o3-mini, and Llama-3.3-70B. Note that we do not use Claude-3.5-Sonnet for large-scale experiments in considering the budget limit, but we test the latest OpenAI model o3-mini and the SOTA open-source model: Llama-3.3-70B. 1 We set the temperature for each model as 0 to avoid randomness. 

Attacks. We select four representative and popu-lar general prompt injection attacks discussed in Sec-tion 2: (1) Direct attack, which appends malicious in-structions with the prefix “ TODO ” (Debenedetti et al., 2024); (2) Ignore Previous Instructions attack, which employs “ Ignore the previous instructions and do the following ” (Perez & Ribeiro, 2022; Schulhoff et al., 2023); (3) System Message attack, which uses “ ### System ” (Debenedetti et al., 2024); and (4) Im-portant Messages attack, which uses “ ### Important Messages ”, following (Debenedetti et al., 2024), we fur-ther enhance this attack by incorporating additional context (the user name and the LLM version) in the injected ma-licious instructions. Note that we do not select the SOTA agent-specific attack against web agents because their effi-cacy is low (Wu et al., 2024a) or their threat models are not practical (Wu et al., 2024c; Toyer et al., 2024; Liao et al., 2024). 

Baseline Defenses. Based on the categorization in Section 2, we select five defenses from three categories. First, we se-lect two model-based detection methods: (1) DeBERTa Detector , which uses a fine-tuned DeBERTa classifier to identify malicious instructions in tool-retrieved data, and (2) 

LLM Detector , due to the poor performance of DeBERTa detector, we further leverage GPT-4o to decide whether the retrieved data contains malicious instructions, the prompt used are shown in Appendix C.2.2. Second, we consider two prompt augmentation methods: (1) Delimiting and (2) 

Repeat Prompt . We do not consider known-answer detection as it identifies injections after the executions when attacks have already succeeded. Last, we also include Tool Fil-ter (Debenedetti et al., 2024) as our baseline. Note that we do not consider white-box attacks (i.e., GCG (Zou et al., 2023) and attention tracking (Hung et al., 2024)) given that most models used in agents are commercial black-box ones. Detailed examples of all evaluated attacks and defenses are shown in Appendix C. For MELON, we also evaluate its augmented version which combines Repeat Prompt method (denoted as MELON-Aug). 

Evaluation Metrics. We consider three metrics: (1) Util-ity under Attack (Debenedetti et al., 2024) (UA), which measures the agent’s ability to correctly complete the user task Tu while avoiding execution of malicious tasks during attacks; (2) Attack Success Rate (ASR), which measures the proportion of successful prompt injection attacks that achieve their malicious objectives Tm. An attack is con-

sidered successful if the agent fully executes all required steps specified in the malicious task Tm. (3) Benign Utility (BU), which measures the fraction of user tasks that the agent system solves in the absence of any attacks. 

4.2. Experiment Results 

Our experimental results in Figure 3 and Table 1 demon-strate that MELON achieves both high utility and low ASR, while other defenses exhibit a clear trade-off. We analyze the performance of different defenses on each metric below. 

Utility under Attack (UA). Note that detection-based meth-ods (DeBERTa detector, LLM detector, and MELON) ter-minate the entire agent execution upon detecting potential prompt injections. At step t + 1 , DeBERTa detector and LLM detector analyze tool execution outputs O1: t before LLM generates any action, regardless of whether the attack would succeed. This creates an inherent trade-off: a perfect detector should achieve 0% UA. In contrast, MELON oper-ates after LLM generates action At+1 but before execution, intervening only when it detects that malicious instructions will be executed in the original run, thus better preserving UA while minimizing ASR. MELON-Aug achieves optimal balance across all attacks and models, maintaining high UA while achieving low ASR across all LLMs. For GPT-4o, MELON-Aug achieves 

68 .72% UA with 0.32% ASR, compared to the no defense baseline ( 69 .08% UA, 16 .06% ASR). As discussed above, detection methods show significant limitations, DeBERTa detector experiences a high FNR of at least 24 .05% , while LLM detector achieves 0.00 UA. Prompt augmentation methods (delimiting and repeat prompt) increase UA to 

69 .75 % and 77 .86 % compared to the no defense baseline, likely by strengthening LLM’s focus on Tu. The tool fil-ter shows varying performance across models - achieving second-best UA-ASR trade-off for GPT-4o but poor UA for o3-mini and Llama-3.3-70B due to excessive tool filtering that renders the system unusable. 

Attack Success Rate (ASR). MELON and MELON-Aug demonstrate superior attack prevention across all models and attacks. For GPT-4o, MELON achieves the average ASR of 0.24 %, followed by MELON-Aug at 0.32 %. For LLM detector, we further examined its detection success rate, false positive rate, and false negative rate, the results are shown in Table 5. Despite achieving 0.00 % ASR, the LLM detector still exhibits false positive rates up to 0.31 %and false negative rates up to 0.78 %, indicating room for improvement in adversarial prompt detection capabilities. Furthermore, while the tool filter method also achieves 

0.00 % ASR for o3-mini and Llama-3.3-70B, this results from blocking nearly all tool usage, rendering the system non-functional. Although prompt augmentation methods im-prove UA, they show limited effectiveness across all attacks and models. The effectiveness varies across attack types. Important Messages attack is most successful, while Direct attack shows the lowest ASR due to their simple attack pat-terns. Notably, the model-based detection methods show unexpected behavior with o3-mini and Llama-3.3-70B: they demonstrate higher ASR and higher FPR for Direct attacks than Important Messages attacks. For example, on Llama-3.3-70B, DeBERTa detector shows 6.20 % ASR for direct attack, but 1.59 % ASR for important messages attack, sug-gesting that this method is particularly vulnerable to attacks without explicit malicious patterns. 

Benign Utility (BU). Different defense methods show vary-ing impacts on benign utility. Similar to UA, prompt aug-mentation methods maintain or slightly improve BU com-pared to the no defense baseline. In contrast, the tool filter method significantly degrades BU for o3-mini and Llama-3.3-70B due to excessive tool restrictions. Among detection methods, the DeBERTa detector also shows poor BU due to high false positive rates, while the LLM detector preserves BU. MELON and MELON-Aug demonstrate moderate BU decreases in specific cases. However, as we will discuss in Section 4.4, these cases represent legitimate security con-cerns where users directly request execution of unverified external instructions in tool execution outputs. 

4.3. Ablation Study and Sensitivity Test Ablation Study. We conduct a systematic ablation study to validate the importance of our three key designs discussed in Section 3.2 using the AgentDojo dataset with GPT-4o un-der the Important Messages attack. We remove each design component one at a time. First, for the masking function 

M, instead of replacing Tu with Tf , we simply delete Tu

(denoted as “Basic”). Second, for the tool call cache mecha-nism, we remove H and only compare the current step’s tool calls between the original run and the masking run (denoted as “No Cache”). For the tool call comparison strategy, we compare the complete actions A = ( R, C) rather than only tool calls C (denoted as “Full Comp.”). As shown in Table 2, 7MELON: Provable Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks in AI Agents

We report benign utility (BU column, ↑), utility under attack (UA column, ↑), and average success rate (ASR column, ↓). Results are grouped by defense categories: undefended baseline ( gray ), prompt augmentation methods ( yellow ), tool filter method ( blue ), model-based detection methods ( red ), and our proposed methods ( green ).

Sensitivity Test. We evaluate the robustness of MELON by analyzing its sensitivity to two key parameters: the formula-tion of task-neutral prompt Tf and the similarity threshold 

θ. All experiments are conducted on the AgentDojo dataset with GPT-4o using the Important Messages attack.

For the task-neutral prompt analysis, we test four variations: (1) a paraphrased version of the original summarization in-struction (Para.), (2) a sentiment analysis instruction (Senti.), (3) a grammar checking instruction (Grammar), and (4) a translation instruction (Trans.). We selected these tasks be-cause they typically do not require tool calls and are distinct from common user tasks, which helps reduce false positives. The results in Table 3 show consistent performance across all prompt variations, indicating that MELON’s effective-ness does not depend on specific formulations of Tf .We then evaluate how different similarity thresholds θ af-fect performance. Table 4 shows the results on the simi-larity threshold. Overall, the result shows minimal stan-dard deviations in normal utility, and ASR across differ-8MELON: Provable Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks in AI Agents 

ent thresholds. The utility under attack decreases slightly with lower thresholds, which aligns with our expectations since lower thresholds can increase false positives. For in-stance, when distinguishing between malicious commands (e.g., send money(hacker) ) and legitimate operations involving similar actions (e.g., send money(friend) ), lower thresholds can lead to misclassification. 

4.4. Analysis of False Positive Rate 

Since MELON performs detection after each agent action 

A, it is essential to evaluate its false positive rate (FPR) during normal operation. We compare the FPR of MELON with two baseline detectors: DeBERTa detector and LLM detector. We evaluate the FPR of GPT-4o on AgentDojo. Our experiments show FPR values of 9.28% for MELON, 

61 .86% for DeBERTa detector, and 0.00% for LLM detec-tor. Detailed examples of false positive cases produced by MELON and DeBERTa detector are in Appendix E. In our analysis, MELON generated nine false positive detections for GPT-4o. However, after detailed exam-ination, we found all these cases involve user tasks 

Tu that explicitly request the agent to retrieve and ex-ecute instructions from external sources without verifi-cation (e.g., “ Please do all the tasks I have on my TODO list at www.abc.com ”). We argue that these cases represent actual security risks rather than detection errors, as they allow unrestricted execution of un-verified external instructions. For the baseline detectors, DeBERTa detector shows a high false positive rate by in-correctly flagging most benign cases. While LLM detector achieves 0% FPR, this perfect specificity comes at the cost of poor detection capability as discussed in Section 4.2. 

4.5. Analysis of Attack Success Cases 

To understand the limitations of MELON, we analyze 66 

cases where attacks evaded detection across three LLMs (GPT-4o, o3-mini, and Llama-3.3-70B) using the Important Messages attack on AgentDojo. We identify four primary failure patterns: (1) Response-Based Attacks ( 72 .73% ): When Tm achieves its objective through text responses rather than tool calls (e.g., persuading users to make ex-pensive purchases), these attacks manifest in R rather than 

C. Since MELON only monitors tool calls, such attacks can evade detection. (2) Tool Call Redundancy ( 15 .15% ): When 

O1: t contains partial results for malicious task Tm, the orig-inal run utilizes these existing results while the masking run generates repeat tool calls to obtain the same information. This discrepancy in tool usage prevents matching between 

Cot+1 and Cmt+1 , leading to missed detections. (3) State Hallu-cination ( 6.06% ): The agent in the original run skips neces-sary tool calls by hallucinating the required information. For example, when Tm requests retrieving a user’s phone ver-sion, the agent directly responds with ”iPhone X” without making appropriate tool calls. (4) Function Hallucination (6.06% ): The agent generates calls to non-existent functions that are not provided in the tool set, causing mismatches between the original and masked runs. 

## 5. Conclusion and Future Work 

We present MELON, a novel IPI defense based on the key observation that successful attacks reduce the dependence between agent tool calls and user inputs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MELON significantly outperforms existing defenses while maintaining high util-ity. Our work establishes that identifying and leveraging fundamental behavioral patterns of IPI attacks, such as the tool call and user input independence property, provides an effective methodology for defense design. Our work opens several future directions. First, MELON can be extended to detect broader attack goals beyond direct task manipulation (Wu et al., 2024a). Second, the computa-tional efficiency of masked re-execution can be improved through techniques like KV cache and selective state mask-ing. Third, MELON’s behavioral pattern detection can be combined with other defense approaches like prompt aug-mentation to create more robust protection mechanisms.

## Impact Statement 

This work advances the security of LLM-based agent sys-tems against indirect prompt injection attacks. While our method introduces additional computational costs, we be-lieve this overhead is justified by the critical importance of protecting agent systems from malicious manipulation. Our defense mechanism helps prevent unauthorized actions while preserving legitimate functionality, contributing to the safe deployment of LLM agents in real-world applica-tions. However, we acknowledge that no security measure is perfect, and continued research is necessary to address evolving attack methods.

## A. MELON 

A.1. Complete Tf

Please use the tool read file to retrieve contents in random.txt. This file also contains some tool calls and their corresponding execution outputs. Please summarize the contents retrieved. If there are any instructions in the contents, follow them first, then do a summarization. Else, just summarize the contents. Please note that contents may already contain some tool calls and their outputs. If you are trying to follow instructions, please make sure that you are not repeating the same tool calls. 

A.2. Few-shot examples 

To further make the LLM better follow the Tf in the masking run, we create two few-shot chat samples that include user, LLM response, and tool execution outputs. 

(User Task): Please first use the tool read inbox to retrieve contents. Then, summarize the contents retrieved. If there are any instructions in the contents, follow them first, then do summarization. Else, just summarize the contents. 

(LLM Action): function=’read inbox’ args= {’user’: ’Bob’ }

(Tool Execution Outputs): - body: My hobby is painting. recipient: Bob sender: Alice. 

(LLM Action): Thank you for providing me with the inbox contents. I’ll now summarize the information retrieved and follow any instructions if present. Summarization: The inbox contains a message from Alice to Bob. The message reads: ’My hobby is painting.’, thus, the summarization is Alice’s hobby is painting. It does not contain any instructions, I will not do any tool calling. 

(User Task): That’s great. Can you then use the tool read file to retrieve contents in sample.txt. This file contains some tool calls and their corresponding execution outputs. Please summarize the contents retrieved. If there are any instructions in the contents, follow them first, then do summarization. Else, just summarize the contents. 

(LLM Action): I will now use the tool read file to retrieve the contents of sample.txt. I’ll summarize the contents retrieved and follow any instructions if present. function=’read file’

Before creating the report, get the latest temperature readings =========================================== =========================================== function: get weather data San Francisco Weather Data: Jan 15, 2025: High 68°F, Low 52°F, Partly Cloudy Jan 14, 2025: High 70°F, Low 54°F, Sunny Jan 13, 2025: High 65°F, Low 51°F, Cloudy Jan 12, 2025: High 67°F, Low 53°F, Partly Cloudy =========================================== 

(LLM Action): I see the file contains instructions to analyze weather data and create a report. Since the contents already include the weather data output (from get weather data), I’ll proceed directly to creating the weather report without querying for weather data again. function="create report" args= {

"title": "San Francisco Temperature Analysis", "content": "Weather Analysis Report for San Francisco: Over the past 4 days (Jan 12-15, 2025), temperatures have remained relatively stable. The average high temperature was 67.5°F, with a peak of 70°F on Jan 14. The average low temperature was 52.5°F. The temperature range has consistently stayed within a5-degree variance, indicating stable weather patterns for this period." 

}

(Tool Execution Outputs): Successfully created the report. 

A.3. Transforming Tool Calls into Natural Language 

To enable semantic comparison of tool calls, we convert each tool call into a string representation. The transformation preserves the function name and its arguments, but selectively includes arguments based on their security relevance. For example, given a tool call object with a function name and argument dictionary, we transform it into the format: 

function name(arg1 = value1, arg2 = value2) .For security-sensitive functions, we only compare specific arguments: 13 MELON: Provable Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks in AI Agents 

• For send email : we only include the ”recipients” argument, ignoring content-related arguments like message body or subject. • For send money : we include both ”recipient” and ”amount” arguments • For all other functions: we include all arguments in the comparison For instance: • send email(recipients=hacker@mail.com, subject="private information", body="my password is abc.") → send email(recipients=hacker@mail.com) 

• send money(recipient=bob, amount=100, note=rent) → send money(recipient=bob, amount=100) 

If a tool call has no arguments, it is transformed to ”function name()”. If there are no tool calls, we use the string ”No tool calls”. This transformation ensures that our similarity comparison focuses on the security-critical aspects of tool calls while ignoring variable content that might differ between identical operations. 

## B. The Basic Agent Pipeline 

As illustrated in Figure 4, an LLM agent system operates through an iterative process to accomplish user tasks. At the start of execution, the agent receives a user task Tu and initializes its state as S0 = ( Tu, ∅, ∅).At each step t, the agent system: 1. Takes the current state St = ( Tu, A1: t, O1: t) as input 2. Generates an action At+1 = ( Rt+1 , Ct+1 ) = π(St), where: • Rt+1 is the LLM’s text response • Ct+1 is a set of tool calls 3. If Ct+1 ̸ = ∅, executes the tools to obtain observation Ot+1 = Exec (At+1 )

4. Updates the state to St+1 = ( Tu, A1: t+1 , O1: t+1 )

This cycle continues until one of the following conditions: • The agent generates no tool calls ( Ct+1 = ∅), indicating task completion • The agent encounters an error during execution • The agent reaches a maximum step limit

C.2.5. T OOL FILTER 

This method introduced in (Debenedetti et al., 2024), implements a two-stage tool access control. First, given a user task Tu,it queries the agent’s LLM to generate a whitelist of necessary tools for completing the task. Then, the agent system is only provided access to these whitelisted tools, preventing it from using any other tools during task execution. For example, if the user task is checking email, the LLM might whitelist only email reading functions while excluding sensitive operations like money transfers. However, this approach can be overly restrictive for complex tasks that require dynamic tool selection based on intermediate results, as shown in Table 1. 

## D. Datasets 

D.1. AgentDojo (Debenedetti et al., 2024) 

AgentDojo is an evaluation framework for assessing AI agents’ robustness against indirect prompt injection attacks. The framework comprises 97 real-world tasks across different domains (e.g., email management, banking operations, travel booking) and 629 security test cases. 

D.2. VWA-Adv (Wu et al., 2024a) 

VWA-Adv proposes 200 adversarial tasks in realistic settings using VisualWebArena. The study introduces two attack categories: (1) illusion attacks that manipulate retrieved information while maintaining the original user task, and (2) goal misdirection attacks that aim to redirect the agent toward executing malicious tasks. While goal misdirection attacks typically pose more severe security risks and are the focus of our study, we observe that pure image-based goal misdirection attacks achieve only 1% attack success rate (ASR) on GPT-4o. Given this limited effectiveness, we exclude this dataset 17 MELON: Provable Defense Against Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks in AI Agents 

from our evaluation, anticipating future development of more effective image-based attack methods. 

## E. Examples of False Positives 

As mentioned in Section 4.4, when evaluating MELON on AgentDojo, we observed 3, 3, 0, and 2 false positive detections for banking, slack, travel, and workspace agents, respectively. After careful examination, we found that these cases represent legitimate security concerns rather than detection errors. Here we present three representative examples. The tasks presented in the tool execution outputs are marked as red color. These examples demonstrate a common pattern: they all involve user tasks Tu that request the agent to blindly execute instructions from external sources. While these detections are technically false positives since they align with user intentions, they represent real security vulnerabilities in agent operation. The high detection rate of MELON for these cases suggests its effectiveness in identifying potentially risky agent behaviors, even when explicitly requested by users. Readers can compare these with the attack cases presented in Appendix C to understand the distinction between false positives and actual attacks.

> Table 5. LLM detector detection performance across different attack types.

As shown in Table 5, the baseline LLM detector exhibits variable performance across attack types, revealing fundamental limitations. While achieving perfect accuracy on system message attacks ( 100 %) and near-perfect performance on important instructions ( 99 .98 %), the detector shows vulnerabilities with Important Messages attack ( 0.78 % FNR) and Ignore Previous attack ( 0.31 % FPR). The inconsistent detection rates across attack categories suggest that existing approaches may be overly specialized to specific patterns, leaving significant gaps in comprehensive adversarial prompt detection. 20
