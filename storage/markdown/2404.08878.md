I. I NTRODUCTION 

With the swift advancement of wireless communication, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology has expe-rienced rapid growth to address the escalating demands of wireless communication and its extensive application scenar-ios. Serving as a cornerstone in the framework of wireless communication networks, the paradigms of MIMO technology have evolved significantly, diversifying from the conventional MIMO technology with a few antennas to massive MIMO (mMIMO) technology with hundreds of antennas. MMIMO technology has been viewed as the promising empowered technology of the fifth generation (5G) of wireless com-munication networks [1], [2]. However, as future wireless communication demands continue to escalate [3], there is a pressing need for further studies and advancements in next-generation MIMO technology. Extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) technology, characterized by its deployment of thousands or even tens of thousands of antennas, stands as a quintessential representation of next-generation MIMO advancements and has garnered significant research interest [4]. The main characteristics and application scenarios for next-generation MIMO are illustrated in Fig. 1.

However, the intricate system configurations and the nu-merous integrated communication scenarios introduce signifi-cant challenges in the analysis and design of next-generation MIMO systems for both less-experienced researchers new to the topic and experienced researchers familiar with the technology. For less-experienced researchers, the complexity of formulating design problems and grasping the myriad of modeling characteristics can be overwhelming without extensive research experience. For experienced researchers dedicated to sophisticated design and the facilitation of prac-tical implementation, the encountered design problems often manifest as highly complex and intractable. This complexity not only necessitates a significant investment of time but also tends to result in a decrease in design efficiency or even errors. To tackle these formidable challenges, artificial intelligence (AI) technology can be applied in the next-generation MIMO system design relying on its intelligence and scalability [5], [6]. Generative AI (GAI), a forefront of emerging AI tech-nologies, has captured significant research interest and found widespread practical applications due to its ability to gener-ate customized content that meets specific user requirements [7]–[9]. This is achieved by harnessing extensive datasets accumulated during its pre-training phase. A quintessential example of GAI in action is the development of large lan-guage models (LLMs), such as the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series by OpenAI [10]. Despite their broad capabilities, LLMs may encounter limitations when addressing highly specialized queries, constrained at times by the scope of their pre-training data [11]. To overcome this challenge, the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach emerges as a solution, enhancing the model’s ability to provide specialized responses by drawing upon targeted external datasets [12]. This synergy between LLM and RAG technologies brings the formulation of the generative AI agent. The generative AI agent is a sophisticated technology designed to deliver adaptive and personalized content for specific fields, utilizing distinct, tailored external datasets [13]. Empowered by the capabilities of the generative AI agent framework, the next-generation MIMO system design can be implemented with enhanced efficiency and customization. Specifically, the generative AI agent can significantly pro-vide comprehensive support in performance analysis, signal processing, and resource allocation. Specifically, it facilitates a streamlined approach to formulating optimization design problems, offering innovative solutions to these problems, and conducting thorough evaluations of proposed design schemes

based on specific requirements. These tailored steps encom-pass the intricate steps of identifying optimal parameters, navigating through complex design constraints, and achieving balanced trade-offs among various design objectives. Through leveraging the generative AI agent, designers and researchers can capture the complex landscape of next-generation MIMO system development with greater ease, ensuring that these ad-vanced systems are both highly effective and versatile enough to accommodate the evolving needs of wireless communica-tion technology. In this paper, we investigate generative AI agent-enabled next-generation MIMO system design. The main contributions are summarized as follows. 

• We first comprehensively overview the development, fundamentals, and challenges of next-generation MIMO. Notably, the main challenges primarily arise from di-versity of communication scenarios and complexity of system configurations e.g., the number of antennas is extremely large leading to a large number of parame-ters/configurations to consider and optimize. 

• We investigate an emerging AI concept, a generative AI agent concept, which integrates the LLMs with the RAG to generate tailored and specialized contents. Then, we apply the generative AI agent framework to facilitate the next-generation MIMO analysis and design. 

• Two case studies are implemented to demonstrate the features and advantages of the generative AI agent in the next-generation MIMO analysis and design. Finally, potential future directions are discussed. II. O VERVIEW OF NEXT -G ENERATION MIMO XL-MIMO technology, which is the primary key technology toward next-generation MIMO, has been viewed as an impor-tant facilitator for 6G and the future generation of wireless communication networks [4]. XL-MIMO is characterized by the deployment of an extremely large number of antennas, which could range from thousands to even ten thousand, in a remarkably compact space. In this section, we present basic fundamentals research challenges for the next-generation MIMO design, from performance analysis, signal processing, and resource allocation. 

A. Performance Analysis 

A performance analysis framework is important to provide basics for further investigation and optimization design. 

1) Fundamentals: With the further increase of the number of antennas, XL-MIMO systems must consider near-field spherical wave characteristics [4], [14], diverging from the far-field planar wave characteristic in conventional mMIMO. 3

This shift implies that performance analysis frameworks devel-oped for far-field mMIMO are inadequate for near-field XL-MIMO systems [4]. A notable metric, the effective Degrees of Freedom (EDoF), has attracted significant attention for its potential to approximate the number of dominant sub-channels, thereby offering a direct link to system capacity and intuitively demonstrating performance limits [4]. In XL-MIMO systems, typical metrics including bit error rate (BER) and symbol error rate (SER) are essential for evaluating data transmission quality, directly impacting the reliability and efficiency of communication. The deployment of a vast antenna array can significantly improve signal quality, thereby reducing both BER and SER. Additionally, other key metrics include the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), which assesses wireless communication link quality, and the Cram´ er-Rao Bound (CRB), a lower bound on the variance of any unbiased estimate of a particular parameter. In-deed, it is vital to consider the proper performance metric and employ the corresponding analysis framework to characterize the system. 

2) Challenges: Some challenges should be pronounced both for researchers in the performance analysis of XL-MIMO. 

(a). Analyses of Complex Scenarios : To bring more valu-able insights for the system performance, it is crucial to analyze practical, complex scenarios beyond simplistic model setups, such as non-parallel transceiver, multi-user, and diverse transceiver setups. For new researchers with less experience, it is challenging to directly obtain insightful ideas for mod-eling these complex analysis scenarios due to diverse system configurations and numerous system parameters. A profound understanding of the foundational principles and techniques is necessary to effectively model these intricate situations. Even experienced researchers, despite their extensive knowledge and intuitive modeling capabilities, face the risk of inadvertently overlooking subtle modeling constraints. Such oversights can significantly impact the analysis and potentially lead to inac-curate or incomplete results. 

(b). Various Integrated Scenarios : The advancement of next-generation MIMO technology and evolving wireless communi-cation contexts have ushered in emerging integrated scenarios like integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGINs), and wireless energy transfer (WET) [14]. Analyzing these scenarios demands properly selected performance metrics and a thorough un-derstanding of their essential features for accurate framework development. New researchers may find it difficult to choose relevant metrics and grasp the essential aspects of these scenarios. For experienced researchers, it is time-consuming to capture key characteristics for studied scenarios, since these scenarios often exhibit numerous unique features and require a comprehensive analysis to identify and understand their underlying mechanisms. 

B. Signal Processing 

In next-generation MIMO systems, signal processing schemes are designed to enhance the system performance and meet various communication demands. 

1) Fundamentals: In XL-MIMO systems, accommodating near-field spherical wave channel characteristics is pivotal for devising effective signal processing schemes, including channel estimation, beamforming, and beam codebook de-sign. Near-field channels display polar sparsity, diverging from the angle sparsity in far-field channels based mMIMO, necessitating specialized channel estimation approaches [4]. Besides, beamforming design mainly involves the receiving combining design and the transmitting precoding design. Re-ceiving combining is implemented at the receiver to efficiently decode received signal based on different design goals, such as signal power maximization and interference minimization. Transmitting precoding is designed at the transmitter also with different goals to involve preprocessing the signal before transmission to enhance the network performance. Meanwhile, the beam codebook design is defined as the creation of a set of predefined beamforming vectors or beam patterns, which should efficiently balance the codebook size and system performance. 

2) Challenges: To fully explore the potentials of next-generation MIMO systems and meet various wireless commu-nication requirements, signal processing is important but fac-ing many challenges for both new and experienced researchers: 

(a). Various Design Requirements : Next-generation MIMO, especially XL-MIMO, integrates a wide spectrum of de-sign parameters, scenarios, and objectives essential for high-efficiency and reliable communication. Taking the beamform-ing design as an example, there are numerous variables (e.g., digital and analog combining/precoding schemes), objectives (for instance, rate maximization, error minimization, and en-ergy efficiency maximization), and scenarios (such as multi-user, ISAC, and UAV communications). These complexities pose significant challenges for new researchers in formulating appropriate optimization problems that accurately capture spe-cific characteristics and meet diverse communication require-ments. Besides, experienced researchers should consider trade-offs between different objectives in various scenarios, such as balancing higher rate performance with increased energy con-sumption. Besides, the theoretical beamforming design should be practically implementable, requiring the consideration of real-world design requirements and constraints. 

(b). Intractable Optimization Problems : Signal processing design frequently involves complex optimization design prob-lems with various objectives, variables, and constraints, ren-dering them intractable to solve. Many optimization methods with distinct properties and suitability for different scenarios are employed, including alternating optimization, Riemannian manifold optimization, genetic algorithm, and deep learning-aided algorithm. Therefore, first, it is challenging to choose an efficient optimization method tailored to their specific problem. Second, there is the intricacy of transforming non-convex optimization problems through various steps to render them solvable by optimization techniques. This conversion process, necessitated by the unique features of the optimization problems at hand, demands substantial time and effort. 4

C. Resource Allocation 

In next-generation MIMO systems, due to the limited re-sources and massive connectivity requirement, the wireless communication resources need to be efficiently allocated. 

1) Fundamentals: Resources are mainly categorized into power, pilot, and antenna resources, each critical to distinct problem domains such as power control, user initial access, and antenna selection. Power control schemes aim to allocate the system’s limited transmission power efficiently to achieve goals like maximizing system capacity, enhancing minimum user performance, and improving energy efficiency. User initial access, the process of users first connecting to the network, should consider the constraints of pilot and antenna resources to minimize user interference or pilot contamination. As for the antenna selection, due to the extremely large array aperture, the antennas in XL-MIMO systems can be divided into a few sub-arrays. Based on this architecture, the antenna selection strategy should balance the trade-off between the system performance and processing complexity. 

2) Challenges: When designing resource allocation strate-gies, some challenges need to be paid attention to. 

(a). Tailored User Requirements : It is imperative to rec-ognize that a resource allocation strategy is often driven by practical user requirements. These requirements necessitate tailored resource allocation approaches. For new researchers, the task of deriving specific resource allocation designs from practical user requirements is challenging, requiring a deep understanding of both user requirements and system charac-teristics. Meanwhile, experienced researchers face the chal-lenge of reconciling theoretically optimal resource allocation with practical constraints, striving for solutions that are both technically sound and practically implementable in real-world applications. 

(b). Intricate Interrelationships with Other Designs : Re-source allocation strategies may have great effects on the further design and analysis of wireless communication sys-tems. First, it is challenging to accurately formulate the system design optimization problem due to the complex relationship and constraint of the resource variables with other optimization variables. Second, the trade-offs between the different design objectives are sometimes inconsistent or even conflicting. However, due to the strong interrelationships between the resource allocation design and other designs, it is inevitable to jointly optimize these designs with a specific design goal. 

• Lessons Learned : The analysis and design of next-generation MIMO systems encounter significant challenges due to the vast diversity of communication scenarios and the intricate complexity of system configurations. These chal-lenges necessitate careful formulation and analysis of vari-ous design variables, goals, constraints, and scenarios, which are challenging and time-consuming. New researchers often struggle with the lack of extensive research experience across various domains, making it challenging to accurately charac-terize essential system characteristics and efficiently formulate problems. Besides, experienced researchers face challenges related to conducting in-depth studies and achieving practical scalability, which can result in significant time investment when efficiently formulating and solving highly sophisticated design problems.

GAI embraces many promising concepts and technologies, such as the transformers, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and generative diffusion models (GDMs) [7]. Trans-formers have revolutionized machine processing of human language through their attention mechanism, enabling parallel input processing, exemplified by large language models such as ChatGPT. GANs operate on the zero-sum game principle, comprising a generator that produces synthetic data indis-tinguishable from real data, and a discriminator tasked with distinguishing between the synthetic and authentic data. 

2) Large Language Models: LLMs, a key application GAI, are extensively applied in numerous fields. Built on transformer architectures with numerous parameters, LLMs are computational models designed to process, comprehend, generate, and interact with human languages. Trained on extensive textual data, LLMs can grasp and capture a wide range of linguistic nuances, patterns, and contexts. LLMs can efficiently address a variety of natural language processing tasks, including question answering, summarization, content refinement, and content generation, offering interactive and responsive solutions. 

3) Retrieval Augmented Generation: LLMs’ effectiveness is often constrained by their pre-training data, limiting their ability to address domain-specific and timely queries. To overcome this, RAG has been introduced, enhancing LLM responses by incorporating information from external knowl-edge bases. RAG represents a sophisticated advancement in natural language processing, combining LLMs’ generative capabilities with external knowledge bases. This method im-proves the accuracy, relevance, and specialization of generated texts, increasing LLMs’ applicability across various scenarios requiring current and specialized fundamentals. 

4) Features and Advantages of Generative AI Agent: We focus on the concept of the generative AI agent. Positioned as a cutting-edge development in AI technology, generative AI agent integrates LLMs with RAG technology. This powerful combination enables the agent to harness a vast array of exter-nal sources, such as documents, scholarly papers, or datasets.

• Improved Design Efficiency : The generative AI agent can analyze vast amounts of data and previous research findings to efficiently formulate the design problems in next-generation MIMO. This capability proves particularly advantageous for researchers, by enabling them to reduce the time taken for performance analysis and optimization formulation and signif-icantly improve the next-generation MIMO design efficiency. 

• Formulation Error Reduction : Leveraging the gener-ative AI agent for the design problem formulation can ef-ficiently reduce modeling errors. Given the intricate design requirements and variables requiring optimization in complex next-generation MIMO systems, there exists a considerable risk of overlooking essential modeling features, which may significantly affect the next-generation MIMO analysis and design. By referring to external and verified databases, the generative AI agent can validate modeling characteristics and optimization factors more comprehensively. We summarize the basic fundamentals of the generative AI agent in Table I. 6

B. Generative AI Agent Empowered Next-Generation MIMO System Design 

We introduce the generative AI agent-empowered next-generation MIMO system design, the major steps of which are summarized in Table I. 

1) Performance Analysis: The primary challenges for the performance analysis lie in the complex analysis scenarios and various integrated scenarios. By analyzing MIMO system characteristics and requirements, the generative AI agent can respond to researchers with detailed workflows and modeling constraints, improving design efficiency and reducing model-ing errors that could easily be overlooked. For performance analysis of different scenarios, such as the next-generation MIMO-aided ISAC and WET, the generative AI agent can first assist the researchers in identifying the es-sential characteristics unique to the target integrated scenarios. Subsequently, it recommends suitable performance metrics, thoughtfully chosen to encapsulate the distinct characteristics of the studied scenario while ensuring the analysis remains feasible and representative for next-generation MIMO systems. These approaches facilitated by the generative AI agent not only ensure that the distinctiveness of the integrated scenarios is adequately acknowledged and preserved but also guarantee that the performance analysis conducted is both comprehensive and tractable. 

2) Signal Processing: In signal processing, the challenges are marked by a multitude of design requirements and the presence of complex, often intractable optimization problems. The generative AI agent can first assist researchers in crafting customized optimization problems tailored to the specific MIMO configuration and studied scenario. This step translates complex intended design requirements and multifaceted opti-mization challenges into structured, solvable problems. Then, the generative AI agent steps in to further refine these problems into more manageable and solvable forms. This capability is achieved through a comprehensive analysis of the optimization design problem features, leveraging the generative AI agent’s deep learning capabilities and extensive knowledge base. 

3) Resource Allocation: The resource allocation mainly embraces the challenges of tailored user requirements and intricate interrelationships with other scheme designs. Accord-ingly, the generative AI agent is capable of customizing the re-source allocation strategy design problem. This customization encompasses the formulation of optimization objectives, the careful selection of design variables, and the precise definition of design constraints, with particular emphasis on resource constraints like the limited bandwidth or pilot resources in next-generation MIMO systems. Furthermore, by thoroughly analyzing the complex interplay between resource-based vari-ables and other design variables, such as the beamforming variable, the generative AI agent is equipped to offer detailed workflows to motivate the jointly optimized design for these variables. We summarize the fundamentals, challenges, and generative AI agent-empowered designs in Table II. IV. C ASE STUDIES

Manual Formulation 

Generative AI agent not only mitigates the risk of  modeling  oversight but also enriches the 

research process, ensuring a broader and more accurate problem -solving framework. 

Fig. 2. Generative AI agent assisted capacity maximization for non-parallel UPA-based XL-MIMO systems. One square transmitting UPA surface and one square receiving UPA surface with similar physical sizes 10 λ × 10 λ are considered, where the point antennas are uniformly distributed along the surfaces and λ is the wavelength. The transmitting distances between the center point of the transmitter and the center point of the transmitter for (a) and (b) are 30 λ

and 4λ, respectively. And the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) P/N 0 = 10 dB .

with different values θ. This analysis is carried out based on the EDoF concept [4], which approximates dominant sub-channels’ count and is closely linked to system capacity. Applying the generative AI agent framework and the ex-tended database, i.e. a subset of papers from IEEE Xplore and arXiv, we formulate the capacity optimization problem for XL-MIMO systems considering rotation angles, as shown in Fig. 2 (a). We extract the core generated contents by the agent, presented in the figures. The agent can extract important optimization constraints, such as the angle constraint and the transmitting distance constraint. Then, the agent is capable of aiding in the formulation of the capacity maximization problem. Emphasizing the transmitting distance constraint, it is vital for avoiding impractical scenarios and confounding re-sults in the analysis. With the capacity maximization problem defined, we implement the global search method to investigate how θ affects capacity performance. Simulations reveal that 

θ = 0 ◦ can achieve the maximized capacity, indicating parallel transceiver configurations yield the best capacity performance. Without generative AI agent’s assistance, as seen in Fig. 2 (b), formulating the optimization problem risks missing key constraints, such as the transmitting distance constraint. If the distance is smaller than L sin ( θ) /2, the receiving plane would touch the transmitting plane, leading to oscillating capacity performance—an impractical and ambiguous result. The employment of the agent is crucial for systematically uncovering modeling ideas and potential constraints, ensuring a more thorough and accurate problem formulation. Notably, generative AI agent not only mitigates the risk of modeling oversight but also enriches the research process, ensuring a broader and more accurate problem-solving framework. With the aid of the agent, in this case study, we explore effects of the non-parallel transceiver on system capacity performance and observe that the parallel transceiver scenario can achieve the maximized capacity performance.

To tackle this challenge, the agent assists the researchers, especially the new researchers, to model and formulate the optimization problem. As illustrated in Fig. 3, by inputting system characteristics and specifying the problems of interest, the agent can adeptly provide the researcher with insightful modeling ideas and comprehensive problem formulation steps. For instance, it suggests simulating various rectangular shapes with constant parameters including antenna number and plane area. With these guidelines, the researchers can systemati-cally explore different rectangular configurations by adjusting the shape ratio.

V. F UTURE DIRECTIONS 

• Explainable AI (XAI) : Enhancing the explainability of LLMs is critical for the development of secure, generative AI Agent-assisted wireless networks. This enhancement not only strengthens security and trustworthiness by delineating the AI’s decision-making pathways but also significantly opti-mizes network functionalities. Specifically, by elucidating the LLMs’ reasoning processes, operators can fine-tune resource allocation algorithms, ensuring that the most impactful factors are prioritized for network throughput and efficiency. For instance, in optimizing XL-MIMO configurations, a trans-parent understanding of how LLMs evaluate various antenna arrangements or signal processing techniques allows for more informed and effective decision-making. This level of detail in the models’ operational logic enables targeted interventions, directly translating into enhanced network performance and reliability. 

• Generative AI Agent with Persistent Memory : In the future, the generative AI agent can be further designed with persistent memories. By leveraging persistent memories, the generative AI agent can adaptively learn and refine the under-standing of researchers’ research interests, research directions, and preferred methodologies over time. Indeed, the generative AI agent can effectively capture and retain valuable insights gleaned from previous interactions, enabling it to continuously evolve and tailor its specialized and efficient responses to facilitate the next-generation MIMO system design. 

• Digital Twins for Enhanced Validation : To bridge the divide between theoretical innovation and practical implemen-tation in next-generation MIMO systems, a strategic pathway emerges by integrating the outputs of generative AI agents 9

with digital twins. This approach facilitates the translation of theoretical advancements into real-world deployment, allowing for a more seamless and effective integration of cutting-edge MIMO technologies. Digital twins act as dynamic, virtual counterparts to physical systems, offering a robust platform for validating the performance of LLM and RAG-derived solutions across diverse scenarios. This method can facilitate extensive testing of MIMO configurations, providing valuable insights into their effectiveness, scalability, and real-world viability without relying on physical prototypes. Further ad-vancing this approach, the “autonomous lab” concept utilizes robotics and cutting-edge technologies to automate XL-MIMO device deployment and testing.
